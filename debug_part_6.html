  <body><div class="class24"><span class="class25">T</span><span class="class26">HE BOY’S NAME WAS SANTIAGO. DUSK</span> was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once stood.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night. There were no wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend the entire next day searching for it.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would have to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable pillows.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars through the half-destroyed roof.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still slept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also </span><span id="page_4" class="class16"/><span class="class16">began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them through the countryside in search of food and water. “They are so used to me that they know my schedule,” he muttered. Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he who had become accustomed to </span><span class="class17">their</span><span class="class16"> schedule.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy prodded them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by name. He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said. So there were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an impression on him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields. Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the girl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only once, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the boy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" id="page_5" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">“I need to sell some wool,” the boy told the merchant.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon. So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I didn’t know shepherds knew how to read,” said a girl’s voice behind him.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia, with flowing black hair, and eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image182.jpg" alt="" class="class28"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books,” he answered. During the two hours that they talked, she told him she was the merchant’s daughter, and spoke of life in the village, where each day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the Andalusian countryside, and related the news from the other towns where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“How did you learn to read?” the girl asked at one point.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Like everybody learns,” he said. “In school.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question. He was sure the girl would never understand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her bright, </span><span id="page_6" class="class16"/><span class="class16">Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise. As the time passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days. He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep. He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">And now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village. He was excited, and at the same time uneasy: maybe the girl had already forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling their wool.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It doesn’t matter,” he said to his sheep. “I know other girls in other places.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that shepherds, like seamen and like traveling salesmen, always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun. They never </span><span id="page_7" class="class16"/><span class="class16">have to make any decisions, he thought. Maybe that’s why they always stay close to me.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives, and didn’t understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content with just food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of their wool, their company, and—once in a while—their meat.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one, they would become aware only after most of the flock had been slaughtered, thought the boy. They trust me, and they’ve forgotten how to rely on their own instincts, because I lead them to nourishment.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with the sycamore growing from within, had been haunted. It had caused him to have the same dream for a second time, and it was causing him to feel anger toward his faithful companions. He drank a bit from the wine that remained from his dinner of the night before, and he gathered his jacket closer to his body. He knew that a few hours from now, with the sun at its zenith, the heat would be so great that he would not be </span><span id="page_8" class="class16"/><span class="class16">able to lead his flock across the fields. It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer. The heat lasted until nightfall, and all that time he had to carry his jacket. But when he thought to complain about the burden of its weight, he remembered that, because he had the jacket, he had withstood the cold of the dawn.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was grateful for the jacket’s weight and warmth.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was to travel, and, after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all the cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read. That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen. His parents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of pride for a simple farm family. They worked hard just to have food and water, like the sheep. He had studied Latin, Spanish, and theology. But ever since he had been a child, he had wanted to know the world, and this was much more important to him than knowing God and learning about man’s sins. One afternoon, on a visit to his family, he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he didn’t want to become a priest. That he wanted to travel.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" id="page_9" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">“People from all over the world have passed through this village, son,” said his father. “They come in search of new things, but when they leave they are basically the same people they were when they arrived. They climb the mountain to see the castle, and they wind up thinking that the past was better than what we have now. They have blond hair, or dark skin, but basically they’re the same as the people who live right here.”</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But I’d like to see the castles in the towns where they live,” the boy explained.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Those people, when they see our land, say that they would like to live here forever,” his father continued.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, I’d like to see their land, and see how they live,” said his son.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The people who come here have a lot of money to spend, so they can afford to travel,” his father said. “Amongst us, the only ones who travel are the shepherds.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, then I’ll be a shepherd!”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">His father said no more. The next day, he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient Spanish gold coins.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I found these one day in the fields. I wanted them to be a part of your inheritance. But use them to buy your flock. Take to the fields, and someday </span><span id="page_10" class="class16"/><span class="class16">you’ll learn that our countryside is the best, and our women are the most beautiful.”</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image211.jpg" alt="" class="class21"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his father’s gaze a desire to be able, himself, to travel the world—a desire that was still alive, despite his father’s having had to bury it, over dozens of years, under the burden of struggling for water to drink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every night of his life.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared. The boy thought back to that conversation with his father, and felt happy; he had already seen many castles and met many women (but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence). He owned a jacket, a book that he could trade for another, and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able every day to live out his dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he had had enough of the sea, he would already have known other cities, other women, and other chances to be happy. I couldn’t have found God in the seminary, he thought, as he looked at the sunrise.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Whenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel. He had never been to that ruined church before, in spite of having traveled through those parts </span><span id="page_11" class="class16"/><span class="class16">many times. The world was huge and inexhaustible; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a while, and he would discover other interesting things. The problem is that they don’t even realize that they’re walking a new road every day. They don’t see that the fields are new and the seasons change. All they think about is food and water.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Maybe we’re all that way, the boy mused. Even me—I haven’t thought of other women since I met the merchant’s daughter. Looking at the sun, he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before midday. There, he could exchange his book for a thicker one, fill his wine bottle, shave, and have a haircut; he had to prepare himself for his meeting with the girl, and he didn’t want to think about the possibility that some other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep, had arrived there before him and asked for her hand.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting, he thought, as he looked again at the position of the sun, and hurried his pace. He had suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa, there was an old woman who interpreted dreams.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house; it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads. The <span id="page_12"/>room’s furnishings consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and two chairs.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well. Then she took both of his hands in hers, and began quietly to pray.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">It sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had experience on the road with Gypsies; they also traveled, but they had no flocks of sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others. It was also said that they had a pact with the devil, and that they kidnapped children and, taking them away to their mysterious camps, made them their slaves. As a child, the boy had always been frightened to death that he would be captured by Gypsies, and this childhood fear returned when the old woman took his hands in hers.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to reassure himself. He didn’t want his hand to begin trembling, showing the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our Father silently.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Very interesting,” said the woman, never taking her eyes from the boy’s hands, and then she fell silent.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and the woman sensed it. He quickly pulled his hands away.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I didn’t come here to have you read my palm,” he said, already regretting having come. He </span><span id="page_13" class="class16"/><span class="class16">thought for a moment that it would be better to pay her fee and leave without learning a thing, that he was giving too much importance to his recurrent dream.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You came so that you could learn about your dreams,” said the old woman. “And dreams are the language of God. When he speaks in our language, I can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in the language of the soul, it is only you who can understand. But, whichever it is, I’m going to charge you for the consultation.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Another trick, the boy thought. But he decided to take a chance. A shepherd always takes his chances with wolves and with drought, and that’s what makes a shepherd’s life exciting.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I have had the same dream twice,” he said. “I dreamed that I was in a field with my sheep, when a child appeared and began to play with the animals. I don’t like people to do that, because the sheep are afraid of strangers. But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them. I don’t know why. I don’t know how animals know the age of human beings.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Tell me more about your dream,” said the woman. “I have to get back to my cooking, and, since you don’t have much money, I can’t give you a lot of time.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while,” continued the boy, a bit upset. “And </span><span id="page_14" class="class16"/><span class="class16">suddenly, the child took me by both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids.”</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image233.jpg" alt="" class="class29"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were. But she said nothing.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,”—he said the last three words slowly, so that the old woman would understand—“the child said to me, ‘If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.’ And, just as she was about to show me the exact location, I woke up. Both times.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The woman was silent for some time. Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m not going to charge you anything now,” she said. “But I want one-tenth of the treasure, if you find it.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy laughed—out of happiness. He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure!</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, interpret the dream,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“First, swear to me. Swear that you will give me one-tenth of your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The shepherd swore that he would. The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s a dream in the language of the world,” she said. “I can interpret it, but the interpretation is </span><span id="page_15" class="class16"/><span class="class16">very difficult. That’s why I feel that I deserve a part of what you find.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in Egypt. I have never heard of them, but, if it was a child who showed them to you, they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make you a rich man.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was surprised, and then irritated. He didn’t need to seek out the old woman for this! But then he remembered that he wasn’t going to have to pay anything.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I didn’t need to waste my time just for this,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It’s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them. And since I am not wise, I have had to learn other arts, such as the reading of palms.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, how am I going to get to Egypt?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I only interpret dreams. I don’t know how to turn them into reality. That’s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And what if I never get to Egypt?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Then I don’t get paid. It wouldn’t be the first time.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And the woman told the boy to leave, saying she had already wasted too much time with him.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">So the boy was disappointed; he decided that he would never again believe in dreams. He </span><span id="page_16" class="class16"/><span class="class16">remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of: he went to the market for something to eat, he traded his book for one that was thicker, and he found a bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had bought. The day was hot, and the wine was refreshing. The sheep were at the gates of the city, in a stable that belonged to a friend. The boy knew a lot of people in the city. That was what made traveling appeal to him—he always made new friends, and he didn’t need to spend all of his time with them. When someone sees the same people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary, they wind up becoming a part of that person’s life. And then they want the person to change. If someone isn’t what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields. Three days from now, he would be with the merchant’s daughter.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He started to read the book he had bought. On the very first page it described a burial ceremony. And the names of the people involved were very difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book, he thought, he would present one person at a time, so </span><span id="page_17" class="class16"/><span class="class16">that the reader wouldn’t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading, he liked the book better; the burial was on a snowy day, and he welcomed the feeling of being cold. As he read on, an old man sat down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What are they doing?” the old man asked, pointing at the people in the plaza.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Working,” the boy answered dryly, making it look as if he wanted to concentrate on his reading.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Actually, he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the merchant’s daughter, so that she could see that he was someone who was capable of doing difficult things. He had already imagined the scene many times; every time, the girl became fascinated when he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front. He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep. Most of them he had read in books, but he would tell them as if they were from his personal experience. She would never know the difference, because she didn’t know how to read.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Meanwhile, the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation. He said that he was tired and thirsty, and asked if he might have a sip of the boy’s wine. The boy offered his bottle, hoping that the old man would leave him alone.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image263.jpg" alt="" id="page_18" class="class30"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the old man wanted to talk, and he asked the boy what book he was reading. The boy was tempted to be rude, and move to another bench, but his father had taught him to be respectful of the elderly. So he held out the book to the man—for two reasons: first, that he, himself, wasn’t sure how to pronounce the title; and second, that if the old man didn’t know how to read, he would probably feel ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Hmm . . .” said the old man, looking at all sides of the book, as if it were some strange object. “This is an important book, but it’s really irritating.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was shocked. The old man knew how to read, and had already read the book. And if the book was irritating, as the old man had said, the boy still had time to change it for another.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in the world say,” continued the old man. “It describes people’s inability to choose their own Personal Legends. And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world’s greatest lie.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What’s the world’s greatest lie?” the boy asked, completely surprised.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That’s the world’s greatest lie.</span><span id="page_19" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s never happened to me,” the boy said. “They wanted me to be a priest, but I decided to become a shepherd.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Much better,” said the old man. “Because you really like to travel.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“He knew what I was thinking,” the boy said to himself. The old man, meanwhile, was leafing through the book, without seeming to want to return it at all. The boy noticed that the man’s clothing was strange. He looked like an Arab, which was not unusual in those parts. Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa; one had only to cross the narrow straits by boat. Arabs often appeared in the city, shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Where are you from?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“From many places.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“No one can be from many places,” the boy said. “I’m a shepherd, and I have been to many places, but I come from only one place—from a city near an ancient castle. That’s where I was born.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well then, we could say that I was born in Salem.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy didn’t know where Salem was, but he didn’t want to ask, fearing that he would appear ignorant. He looked at the people in the plaza for a while; they were coming and going, and all of them seemed to be very busy</span><span id="page_20" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“So, what is Salem like?” he asked, trying to get some sort of clue.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s like it always has been.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">No clue yet. But he knew that Salem wasn’t in Andalusia. If it were, he would already have heard of it.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And what do you do in Salem?” he insisted.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What do I do in Salem?” The old man laughed. “Well, I’m the king of Salem!”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">People say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it’s better to be with the sheep, who don’t say anything. And better still to be alone with one’s books. They tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them. But when you’re talking to people, they say some things that are so strange that you don’t know how to continue the conversation.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“My name is Melchizedek,” said the old man. “How many sheep do you have?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Enough,” said the boy. He could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, then, we’ve got a problem. I can’t help you if you feel you’ve got enough sheep.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was getting irritated. He wasn’t asking for help. It was the old man who had asked for a drink of his wine, and had started the conversation</span><span id="page_21" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Give me my book,” the boy said. “I have to go and gather my sheep and get going.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Give me one-tenth of your sheep,” said the old man, “and I’ll tell you how to find the hidden treasure.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy remembered his dream, and suddenly everything was clear to him. The old woman hadn’t charged him anything, but the old man—maybe he was her husband—was going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something that didn’t even exist. The old man was probably a Gypsy, too.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But before the boy could say anything, the old man leaned over, picked up a stick, and began to write in the sand of the plaza. Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded. With a movement that was too quick for someone his age, the man covered whatever it was with his cape. When his vision returned to normal, the boy was able to read what the old man had written in the sand.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">There, in the sand of the plaza of that small city, the boy read the names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he had attended. He read the name of the merchant’s daughter, which he hadn’t even known, and he read things he had never told anyone.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" id="page_22" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">“I’m the king of Salem,” the old man had said.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?” the boy asked, awed and embarrassed.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“For several reasons. But let’s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy didn’t know what a person’s “Personal Legend” was.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy. But he wanted to know what the “mysterious force” was; the merchant’s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that!</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you how to realize your Personal Legend. It prepares your spirit and your will, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, </span><span id="page_23" class="class16"/><span class="class16">it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. It’s your mission on earth.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Even when all you want to do is travel? Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Yes, or even search for treasure. The Soul of the World is nourished by people’s happiness. And also by unhappiness, envy, and jealousy. To realize one’s Personal Legend is a person’s only real obligation. All things are one.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the townspeople. It was the old man who spoke first.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why do you tend a flock of sheep?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because I like to travel.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at one corner of the plaza. “When he was a child, that man wanted to travel, too. But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside. When he’s an old man, he’s going to spend a month in Africa. He never realized that people are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“He should have decided to become a shepherd,” the boy said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, he thought about that,” the old man said. “But bakers are more important people than shepherds. Bakers have homes, while shepherds sleep </span><span id="page_24" class="class16"/><span class="class16">out in the open. Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy felt a pang in his heart, thinking about the merchant’s daughter. There was surely a baker in her town.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The old man continued, “In the long run, what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The old man leafed through the book, and fell to reading a page he came to. The boy waited, and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted. “Why are you telling me all this?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend. And you are at the point where you’re about to give it all up.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And that’s when you always appear on the scene?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Not always in this way, but I always appear in one form or another. Sometimes I appear in the form of a solution, or a good idea. At other times, at a crucial moment, I make it easier for things to happen. There are other things I do, too, but most of the time people don’t realize I’ve done them.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to appear before a miner, and had taken the form of a stone. The miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years he had been working a certain river, and </span><span id="page_25" class="class16"/><span class="class16">had examined hundreds of thousands of stones looking for an emerald. The miner was about to give it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one more stone—just </span><span class="class17">one more</span><span class="class16">—he would find his emerald. Since the miner had sacrificed everything to his Personal Legend, the old man decided to become involved. He transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner’s foot. The miner, with all the anger and frustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the stone and threw it aside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it fell upon, and there, embedded in the broken stone, was the most beautiful emerald in the world.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,” said the old man, with a certain bitterness. “Maybe that’s why they give up on it so early, too. But that’s the way it is.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is buried by the same currents,” said the old man. “If you want to learn about your own treasure, you will have to give me one-tenth of your flock.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What about one-tenth of my treasure?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The old man looked disappointed. “If you start out by promising what you don’t even have yet, you’ll lose your desire to work toward getting it.</span><span id="page_26" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that,” sighed the old man. “In any case, it’s good that you’ve learned that everything in life has its price. This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The old man returned the book to the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Tomorrow, at this same time, bring me a tenth of your flock. And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure. Good afternoon.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And he vanished around the corner of the plaza.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The boy began again to read his book, but he was no longer able to concentrate. He was tense and upset, because he knew that the old man was right. He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of bread, thinking about whether or not he should tell the baker what the old man had said about him. Sometimes it’s better to leave things as they are, he thought to himself, and decided to say nothing. If he were to say anything, the baker would spend three days thinking about giving it all up, even though he had gotten used to the way things were. The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker. So he began to wander through the city, and found himself at the gates. There was a small building there, with a <span id="page_27"/>window at which people bought tickets to Africa. And he knew that Egypt was in Africa.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Can I help you?” asked the man behind the window.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Maybe tomorrow,” said the boy, moving away. If he sold just one of his sheep, he’d have enough to get to the other shore of the strait. The idea frightened him.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Another dreamer,” said the ticket seller to his assistant, watching the boy walk away. “He doesn’t have enough money to travel.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">While standing at the ticket window, the boy had remembered his flock, and decided he should go back to being a shepherd. In two years he had learned everything about shepherding: he knew how to shear sheep, how to care for pregnant ewes, and how to protect the sheep from wolves. He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia. And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image337.jpg" alt="" class="class31"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He decided to return to his friend’s stable by the longest route possible. As he walked past the city’s castle, he interrupted his return, and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall. From there, he could see Africa in the distance. Someone had once told him that it was from there that the Moors had come, to occupy all of Spain.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including the plaza where he had talked with the </span><span id="page_28" class="class16"/><span class="class16">old man. Curse the moment I met that old man, he thought. He had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream. Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd. They were solitary individuals who no longer believed in things, and didn’t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep. He knew everything about each member of his flock: he knew which ones were lame, which one was to give birth two months from now, and which were the laziest. He knew how to shear them, and how to slaughter them. If he ever decided to leave them, they would suffer.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The wind began to pick up. He knew that wind: people called it the levanter, because on it the Moors had come from the Levant at the eastern end of the Mediterranean.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The levanter increased in intensity. Here I am, between my flock and my treasure, the boy thought. He had to choose between something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted to have. There was also the merchant’s daughter, but she wasn’t as important as his flock, because she didn’t depend on him. Maybe she didn’t even remember him. He was sure that it made no difference to her on which day he appeared: for her, every day was the same, and when each day is the same as the next, it’s because people </span><span id="page_29" class="class16"/><span class="class16">fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">I left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. They have gotten used to my being away, and so have I. The sheep will get used to my not being there, too, the boy thought.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">From where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued to come and go from the baker’s shop. A young couple sat on the bench where he had talked with the old man, and they kissed.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That baker . . .” he said to himself, without completing the thought. The levanter was still getting stronger, and he felt its force on his face. That wind had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women. It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search for the unknown, and for gold and adventure—and for the Pyramids. The boy felt jealous of the freedom of the wind, and saw that he could have the same freedom. There was nothing to hold him back except himself. The sheep, the merchant’s daughter, and the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The next day, the boy met the old man at noon. He brought six sheep with him.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m surprised,” the boy said. “My friend bought all the other sheep immediately. He said that he </span><span id="page_30" class="class16"/><span class="class16">had always dreamed of being a shepherd, and that it was a good omen.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s the way it always is,” said the old man. “It’s called the principle of favorability. When you play cards the first time, you are almost sure to win. Beginner’s luck.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why is that?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend; it whets your appetite with a taste of success.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Then the old man began to inspect the sheep, and he saw that one was lame. The boy explained that it wasn’t important, since that sheep was the most intelligent of the flock, and produced the most wool.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Where is the treasure?” he asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s in Egypt, near the Pyramids.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was startled. The old woman had said the same thing. But she hadn’t charged him anything.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens. God has prepared a path for everyone to follow. You just have to read the omens that he left for you.”</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image358.jpg" alt="" class="class21"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Before the boy could reply, a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man. He remembered something his grandfather had once told him: that butterflies were a good omen. Like </span><span id="page_31" class="class16"/><span class="class16">crickets, and like grasshoppers; like lizards and four-leaf clovers.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s right,” said the old man, able to read the boy’s thoughts. “Just as your grandfather taught you. These are good omens.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The old man opened his cape, and the boy was struck by what he saw. The old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold, covered with precious stones. The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He really was a king! He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Take these,” said the old man, holding out a white stone and a black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate. “They are called Urim and Thummim. The black signifies ‘yes,’ and the white ‘no.’ When you are unable to read the omens, they will help you to do so. Always ask an objective question.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But, if you can, try to make your own decisions. The treasure is at the Pyramids; that you already knew. But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy put the stones in his pouch. From then on, he would make his own decisions.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Don’t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else. And don’t forget </span><span id="page_32" class="class16"/><span class="class16">the language of omens. And, above all, don’t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But before I go, I want to tell you a little story.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world. The lad wandered through the desert for forty days, and finally came upon a beautiful castle, high atop a mountain. It was there that the wise man lived.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Rather than finding a saintly man, though, our hero, on entering the main room of the castle, saw a hive of activity: tradesmen came and went, people were conversing in the corners, a small orchestra was playing soft music, and there was a table covered with platters of the most delicious food in that part of the world. The wise man conversed with everyone, and the boy had to wait for two hours before it was his turn to be given the man’s attention.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The wise man listened attentively to the boy’s explanation of why he had come, but told him that he didn’t have time just then to explain the secret of happiness. He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do something,’ said the wise man, handing the boy a teaspoon that held two drops of oil. ‘As you wander around, carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil to spill.</span><span id="page_33" class="class16"/><span class="class16">’</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of the palace, keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon. After two hours, he returned to the room where the wise man was.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘Well,’ asked the wise man, ‘did you see the Persian tapestries that are hanging in my dining hall? Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create? Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library?’</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The boy was embarrassed, and confessed that he had observed nothing. His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘Then go back and observe the marvels of my world,’ said the wise man. ‘You cannot trust a man if you don’t know his house.’</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Relieved, the boy picked up the spoon and returned to his exploration of the palace, this time observing all of the works of art on the ceilings and the walls. He saw the gardens, the mountains all around him, the beauty of the flowers, and the taste with which everything had been selected. Upon returning to the wise man, he related in detail everything he had seen.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image379.jpg" alt="" class="class21"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you?’ asked the wise man.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Looking down at the spoon he held, the boy saw that the oil was gone</span><span id="page_34" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘Well, there is only one piece of advice I can give you,’ said the wisest of wise men. ‘The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.’”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The shepherd said nothing. He had understood the story the old king had told him. A shepherd may like to travel, but he should never forget about his sheep.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The old man looked at the boy and, with his hands held together, made several strange gestures over the boy’s head. Then, taking his sheep, he walked away.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">At the highest point in Tarifa there is an old fort, built by the Moors. From atop its walls, one can catch a glimpse of Africa. Melchizedek, the king of Salem, sat on the wall of the fort that afternoon, and felt the levanter blowing in his face. The sheep fidgeted nearby, uneasy with their new owner and excited by so much change. All they wanted was food and water.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port. He would never again see the boy, just as he had never seen Abraham again after having charged him his one-tenth fee. That was his work</span><span id="page_35" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The gods should not have desires, because they don’t have Personal Legends. But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">It’s too bad that he’s quickly going to forget my name, he thought. I should have repeated it for him. Then when he spoke about me he would say that I am Melchizedek, the king of Salem.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He looked to the skies, feeling a bit abashed, and said, “I know it’s the vanity of vanities, as you said, my Lord. But an old king sometimes has to take some pride in himself.”</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">How strange Africa is, thought the boy.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier. Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other. In just a few hours he had seen men walking hand in hand, women with their faces covered, and priests that climbed to the tops of towers and chanted—as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“A practice of infidels,” he said to himself. As a child in church, he had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his white horse, his sword unsheathed, and figures such as these </span><span id="page_36" class="class16"/><span class="class16">kneeling at his feet. The boy felt ill and terribly alone. The infidels had an evil look about them.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Besides this, in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail, just one detail, which could keep him from his treasure for a long time: only Arabic was spoken in this country.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The owner of the bar approached him, and the boy pointed to a drink that had been served at the next table. It turned out to be a bitter tea. The boy preferred wine.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But he didn’t need to worry about that right now. What he had to be concerned about was his treasure, and how he was going to go about getting it. The sale of his sheep had left him with enough money in his pouch, and the boy knew that in money there was magic; whoever has money is never really alone. Before long, maybe in just a few days, he would be at the Pyramids. An old man, with a breastplate of gold, wouldn’t have lied just to acquire six sheep.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The old man had spoken about signs and omens, and, as the boy was crossing the strait, he had thought about omens. Yes, the old man had known what he was talking about: during the time the boy had spent in the fields of Andalusia, he had become used to learning which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky. He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a snake was nearby, and that a certain </span><span id="page_37" class="class16"/><span class="class16">shrub was a sign that there was water in the area. The sheep had taught him that.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">If God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he thought, and that made him feel better. The tea seemed less bitter.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Who are you?” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was relieved. He was thinking about omens, and someone had appeared.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“How come you speak Spanish?” he asked. The new arrival was a young man in Western dress, but the color of his skin suggested he was from this city. He was about the same age and height as the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Almost everyone here speaks Spanish. We’re only two hours from Spain.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Sit down, and let me treat you to something,” said the boy. “And ask for a glass of wine for me. I hate this tea.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“There is no wine in this country,” the young man said. “The religion here forbids it.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids. He almost began to tell about his treasure, but decided not to do so. If he did, it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as payment for taking him there. He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn’t even have yet.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’d like you to take me there if you can. I can pay you to serve as my guide.</span><span id="page_38" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Do you have any idea how to get there?” the newcomer asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby, listening attentively to their conversation. He felt uneasy at the man’s presence. But he had found a guide, and didn’t want to miss out on an opportunity.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You have to cross the entire Sahara desert,” said the young man. “And to do that, you need money. I need to know whether you have enough.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy thought it a strange question. But he trusted in the old man, who had said that, when you really want something, the universe always conspires in your favor.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man. The owner of the bar came over and looked, as well. The two men exchanged some words in Arabic, and the bar owner seemed irritated.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Let’s get out of here,” said the new arrival. “He wants us to leave.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was relieved. He got up to pay the bill, but the owner grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of words. The boy was strong, and wanted to retaliate, but he was in a foreign country. His new friend pushed the owner aside, and pulled the boy outside with him. “He wanted your money,” he said. “Tangier is not like </span><span id="page_39" class="class16"/><span class="class16">the rest of Africa. This is a port, and every port has its thieves.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy trusted his new friend. He had helped him out in a dangerous situation. He took out his money and counted it.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow,” said the other, taking the money. “But I have to buy two camels.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier. Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale. They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held. There were thousands of people there, arguing, selling, and buying; vegetables for sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed alongside tobacco. But the boy never took his eye off his new friend. After all, he had all his money. He thought about asking him to give it back, but decided that would be unfriendly. He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’ll just watch him,” he said to himself. He knew he was stronger than his friend.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Suddenly, there in the midst of all that confusion, he saw the most beautiful sword he had ever seen. The scabbard was embossed in silver, and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones. The boy promised himself that, when he returned from Egypt, he would buy that sword</span><span id="page_40" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs,” he said to his friend. Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments, looking at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest had suddenly compressed it. He was afraid to look around, because he knew what he would find. He continued to look at the beautiful sword for a bit longer, until he summoned the courage to turn around.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image423.jpg" alt="" class="class28"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">All around him was the market, with people coming and going, shouting and buying, and the aroma of strange foods . . . but nowhere could he find his new companion.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident. He decided to stay right there and await his return. As he waited, a priest climbed to the top of a nearby tower and began his chant; everyone in the market fell to their knees, touched their foreheads to the ground, and took up the chant. Then, like a colony of worker ants, they dismantled their stalls and left.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The sun began its departure, as well. The boy watched it through its trajectory for some time, until it was hidden behind the white houses surrounding the plaza. He recalled that when the sun had risen that morning, he was on another continent, still a shepherd with sixty sheep, and looking </span><span id="page_41" class="class16"/><span class="class16">forward to meeting with a girl. That morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him as he walked through the familiar fields. But now, as the sun began to set, he was in a different country, a stranger in a strange land, where he couldn’t even speak the language. He was no longer a shepherd, and he had nothing, not even the money to return and start everything over.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">All this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought. He was feeling sorry for himself, and lamenting the fact that his life could have changed so suddenly and so drastically.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry. He had never even wept in front of his own sheep. But the marketplace was empty, and he was far from home, so he wept. He wept because God was unfair, and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When I had my sheep, I was happy, and I made those around me happy. People saw me coming and welcomed me, he thought. But now I’m sad and alone. I’m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me. I’m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine. And I’m going to hold on to what little I have, because I’m too insignificant to conquer the world</span><span id="page_42" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions; maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship. But all he found was the heavy book, his jacket, and the two stones the old man had given him.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">As he looked at the stones, he felt relieved for some reason. He had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate. He could sell the stones and buy a return ticket. But this time I’ll be smarter, the boy thought, removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket. This was a port town, and the only truthful thing his friend had told him was that port towns are full of thieves.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image434.jpg" alt="" class="class32"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset: he was trying to tell him not to trust that man. “I’m like everyone else—I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He ran his fingers slowly over the stones, sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces. They were his treasure. Just handling them made him feel better. They reminded him of the old man.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it,” he had said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said. There he was in the empty marketplace, without a cent to his name, and with not a sheep to guard through the night. </span><span id="page_43" class="class16"/><span class="class16">But the stones were proof that he had met with a king—a king who knew of the boy’s past.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“They’re called Urim and Thummim, and they can help you to read the omens.” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment. The old man had said to ask very clear questions, and to do that, the boy had to know what he wanted. So, he asked if the old man’s blessing was still with him.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He took out one of the stones. It was “yes.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Am I going to find my treasure?” he asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the stones. As he did so, both of them pushed through a hole in the pouch and fell to the ground. The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch. He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch. But as he saw them lying there on the ground, another phrase came to his mind.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Learn to recognize omens, and follow them,” the old king had said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">An omen. The boy smiled to himself. He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch. He didn’t consider mending the hole—the stones could fall through any time they wanted. He had learned that there were certain things one shouldn’t ask about, so as not to flee from one’s own Personal Legend. “I promised that I would make my own decisions,” he said to himself</span><span id="page_44" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the stones had told him that the old man was still with him, and that made him feel more confident. He looked around at the empty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn’t a strange place; it was a new one.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">After all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new places. Even if he never got to the Pyramids, he had already traveled farther than any shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how different things are just two hours by ship from where they are, he thought. Although his new world at the moment was just an empty marketplace, he had already seen it when it was teeming with life, and he would never forget it. He remembered the sword. It hurt him a bit to think about it, but he had never seen one like it before. As he mused about these things, he realized that he had to choose between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m an adventurer, looking for treasure,” he said to himself.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">He was shaken into wakefulness by someone. He had fallen asleep in the middle of the marketplace, and life in the plaza was about to resume.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he was in a new world. But instead of </span><span id="page_45" class="class16"/><span class="class16">being saddened, he was happy. He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep; he could go in search of his treasure, instead. He had not a cent in his pocket, but he had faith. He had decided, the night before, that he would be as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He walked slowly through the market. The merchants were assembling their stalls, and the boy helped a candy seller to do his. The candy seller had a smile on his face: he was happy, aware of what his life was about, and ready to begin a day’s work. His smile reminded the boy of the old man—the mysterious old king he had met. “This candy merchant isn’t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper’s daughter. He’s doing it because it’s what he wants to do,” thought the boy. He realized that he could do the same thing the old man had done—sense whether a person was near to or far from his Personal Legend. Just by looking at them. It’s easy, and yet I’ve never done it before, he thought.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When the stall was assembled, the candy seller offered the boy the first sweet he had made for the day. The boy thanked him, ate it, and went on his way. When he had gone only a short distance, he realized that, while they were erecting the stall, one of them had spoken Arabic and the other Spanish.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And they had understood each other perfectly well</span><span id="page_46" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">There must be a language that doesn’t depend on words, the boy thought. I’ve already had that experience with my sheep, and now it’s happening with people.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things that he had already experienced, and weren’t really new, but that he had never perceived before. And he hadn’t perceived them because he had become accustomed to them. He realized: If I can learn to understand this language without words, I can learn to understand the world.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Relaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of Tangier. Only in that way would he be able to read the omens. He knew it would require a lot of patience, but shepherds know all about patience. Once again he saw that, in that strange land, he was applying the same lessons he had learned with his sheep.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“All things are one,” the old man had said.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The crystal merchant awoke with the day, and felt the same anxiety that he felt every morning. He had been in the same place for thirty years: a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed. Now it was too late to change anything—the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware. There had been a time when many people knew of his shop: Arab <span id="page_47"/>merchants, French and English geologists, German soldiers who were always well-heeled. In those days it had been wonderful to be selling crystal, and he had thought how he would become rich, and have beautiful women at his side as he grew older.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of Ceuta had grown faster than Tangier, and business had fallen off. Neighbors moved away, and there remained only a few small shops on the hill. And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years of his life buying and selling crystal pieces, and now it was too late to do anything else.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street. He had done this for years, and knew the schedule of everyone who passed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy stopped in front of the shop. He was dressed normally, but the practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no money to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant decided to delay his lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">A card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop. The boy saw a man appear behind the counter<span id="page_48"/>.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I can clean up those glasses in the window, if you want,” said the boy. “The way they look now, nobody is going to want to buy them.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The man looked at him without responding.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“In exchange, you could give me something to eat.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The man still said nothing, and the boy sensed that he was going to have to make a decision. In his pouch, he had his jacket—he certainly wasn’t going to need it in the desert. Taking the jacket out, he began to clean the glasses. In half an hour, he had cleaned all the glasses in the window, and, as he was doing so, two customers had entered the shop and bought some crystal.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When he had completed the cleaning, he asked the man for something to eat. “Let’s go and have some lunch,” said the crystal merchant.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image473.jpg" alt="" class="class21"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He put a sign on the door, and they went to a small café nearby. As they sat down at the only table in the place, the crystal merchant laughed.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You didn’t have to do any cleaning,” he said. “The Koran requires me to feed a hungry person.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well then, why did you let me do it?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because the crystal was dirty. And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When they had eaten, the merchant turned to the boy and said, “I’d like you to work in my shop. </span><span id="page_49" class="class16"/><span class="class16">Two customers came in today while you were working, and that’s a good omen.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">People talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they really don’t know what they’re saying. Just as I hadn’t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Do you want to go to work for me?” the merchant asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I can work for the rest of today,” the boy answered. “I’ll work all night, until dawn, and I’ll clean every piece of crystal in your shop. In return, I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The merchant laughed. “Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year . . . even if you earned a good commission selling every piece, you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt. There are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep. No sound from the bazaars, no arguments among the merchants, no men climbing to the towers to chant. No hope, no adventure, no old kings or Personal Legends, no treasure, and no Pyramids. It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy’s soul had. He sat there, staring blankly through the door of the café, wishing that he had died, and that everything would end forever at that moment</span><span id="page_50" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The merchant looked anxiously at the boy. All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I can give you the money you need to get back to your country, my son,” said the crystal merchant.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy said nothing. He got up, adjusted his clothing, and picked up his pouch.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’ll work for you,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And after another long silence, he added, “I need money to buy some sheep.”</span></div>
