  <body><div class="class24"><span class="class25">T</span><span class="class26">HE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE</span> crystal merchant for almost a month, and he could see that it wasn’t exactly the kind of job that would make him happy. The merchant spent the entire day mumbling behind the counter, telling the boy to be careful with the pieces and not to break anything.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he was an old grouch, treated him fairly; the boy received a good commission for each piece he sold, and had already been able to put some money aside. That morning he had done some calculating: if he continued to work every day as he had been, he would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’d like to build a display case for the crystal,” the boy said to the merchant. “We could place it outside, and attract those people who pass at the bottom of the hill.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’ve never had one before,” the merchant answered. “People will pass by and bump into it, and pieces will be broken.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them might have died if we had come upon a snake. But that’s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds.</span><span id="page_54" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses. He was selling better than ever . . . as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier’s major attractions.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Business has really improved,” he said to the boy, after the customer had left. “I’m doing much better, and soon you’ll be able to return to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because we have to respond to omens,” the boy said, almost without meaning to; then he regretted what he had said, because the merchant had never met the king.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s called the principle of favorability, beginner’s luck. Because life wants you to achieve your Personal Legend,” the old king had said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the merchant understood what the boy had said. The boy’s very presence in the shop was an omen, and, as time passed and money was pouring into the cash drawer, he had no regrets about having hired the boy. The boy was being paid more money than he deserved, because the merchant, thinking that sales wouldn’t amount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate. He had assumed he would soon return to his sheep.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?” he asked, to get away from the business of the display.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because I’ve always heard about them,” the boy answered, saying nothing about his dream. The </span><span id="page_55" class="class16"/><span class="class16">treasure was now nothing but a painful memory, and he tried to avoid thinking about it.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I don’t know anyone around here who would want to cross the desert just to see the Pyramids,” said the merchant. “They’re just a pile of stones. You could build one in your backyard.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You’ve never had dreams of travel,” said the boy, turning to wait on a customer who had entered the shop.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Two days later, the merchant spoke to the boy about the display.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I don’t much like change,” he said. “You and I aren’t like Hassan, that rich merchant. If he makes a buying mistake, it doesn’t affect him much. But we two have to live with our mistakes.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">That’s true enough, the boy thought, ruefully.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why did you think we should have the display?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I want to get back to my sheep faster. We have to take advantage when luck is on our side, and do as much to help it as it’s doing to help us. It’s called the principle of favorability. Or beginner’s luck.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, “The Prophet gave us the Koran, and left us just five obligations to satisfy during our lives. The most important is to believe only in the one true God. The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan, and be charitable to the poor.</span><span id="page_56" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the Prophet. He was a devout man, and, even with all his impatience, he wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What’s the fifth obligation?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel,” the merchant answered. “The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a pilgrimage. We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy city of Mecca.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was young, all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start this shop. I thought that someday I’d be rich, and could go to Mecca. I began to make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the shop; the crystals are delicate things. At the same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading for Mecca. Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans with servants and camels, but most of the people making the pilgrimage were poorer than I.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses. One of them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had traveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather.</span><span id="page_57" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, why don’t you go to Mecca now?” asked the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That’s what helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible café. I’m afraid that if my dream is realized, I’ll have no reason to go on living.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you’re different from me, because you want to realize your dreams. I just want to dream about Mecca. I’ve already imagined a thousand times crossing the desert, arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone, the seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it. I’ve already imagined the people who would be at my side, and those in front of me, and the conversations and prayers we would share. But I’m afraid that it would all be a disappointment, so I prefer just to dream about it.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">That day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display. Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">Two more months passed, and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop. The boy estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet another sixty. In less than a year, he <span id="page_58"/>would have doubled his flock, and he would be able to do business with the Arabs, because he was now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in the marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim and Thummim, because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, the boy had become happy in his work, and thought all the time about the day when he would disembark at Tarifa as a winner.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You must always know what it is that you want,” the old king had said. The boy knew, and was now working toward it. Maybe it was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a thief, and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He was proud of himself. He had learned some important things, like how to deal in crystal, and about the language without words . . . and about omens. One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of the hill, complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to get something to drink after such a climb. The boy, accustomed to recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Let’s sell tea to the people who climb the hill.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Lots of places sell tea around here,” the merchant said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But we could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the </span><span id="page_59" class="class16"/><span class="class16">glasses. I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The merchant didn’t respond, but that afternoon, after saying his prayers and closing the shop, he invited the boy to sit with him and share his hookah, that strange pipe used by the Arabs.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image542.jpg" alt="" class="class31"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What is it you’re looking for?” asked the old merchant.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’ve already told you. I need to buy my sheep back, so I have to earn the money to do so.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled deeply.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’ve had this shop for thirty years. I know good crystal from bad, and everything else there is to know about crystal. I know its dimensions and how it behaves. If we serve tea in crystal, the shop is going to expand. And then I’ll have to change my way of life.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, isn’t that good?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was thinking about how much time I had wasted in the same place, while my friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better than they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I can see that it hasn’t been too bad. The shop is exactly the size I always wanted it to be. I don’t want to change anything, because I don’t know how to deal with change. I’m used to the way I am.</span><span id="page_60" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy didn’t know what to say. The old man continued, “You have been a real blessing to me. Today, I understand something I didn’t see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don’t want anything else in life. But you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I’m going to feel worse than I did before you arrived. Because I know the things I should be able to accomplish, and I don’t want to do so.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">It’s good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa, thought the boy to himself.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set. They were conversing in Arabic, and the boy was proud of himself for being able to do so. There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world. But they could never have taught him Arabic.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can’t teach me, thought the boy as he regarded the old merchant. All they ever do, really, is look for food and water. And maybe it wasn’t that they were teaching me, but that I was learning from them.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class17">“Maktub,”</span><span class="class16"> the merchant said, finally</span><span id="page_61" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What does that mean?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You would have to have been born an Arab to understand,” he answered. “But in your language it would be something like ‘It is written.’”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And, as he smothered the coals in the hookah, he told the boy that he could begin to sell tea in the crystal glasses. Sometimes, there’s just no way to hold back the river.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The men climbed the hill, and they were tired when they reached the top. But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing mint tea. They went in to drink the tea, which was served in beautiful crystal glasses.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“My wife never thought of this,” said one, and he bought some crystal—he was entertaining guests that night, and the guests would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware. The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in crystal, because the aroma was retained. The third said that it was a tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Before long, the news spread, and a great many people began to climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so </span><span id="page_62" class="class16"/><span class="class16">old. Other shops were opened that served tea in crystal, but they weren’t at the top of a hill, and they had little business.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Eventually, the merchant had to hire two more employees. He began to import enormous quantities of tea, along with his crystal, and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And, in that way, the months passed.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The boy awoke before dawn. It had been eleven months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought especially for this day. He put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin. Wearing his new sandals, he descended the stairs silently.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass. Then he sat in the sun-filled doorway, smoking the hookah.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He smoked in silence, thinking of nothing, and listening to the sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert. When he had finished his smoke, he reached into one of his pockets, and sat there for a few moments, regarding what he had withdrawn</span><span id="page_63" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">It was a bundle of money. Enough to buy himself a hundred and twenty sheep, a return ticket, and a license to import products from Africa into his own country.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop. Then the two went off to have some more tea.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m leaving today,” said the boy. “I have the money I need to buy my sheep. And you have the money you need to go to Mecca.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The old man said nothing.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Will you give me your blessing?” asked the boy. “You have helped me.” The man continued to prepare his tea, saying nothing. Then he turned to the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I am proud of you,” he said. “You brought a new feeling into my crystal shop. But you know that I’m not going to go to Mecca. Just as you know that you’re not going to buy your sheep.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Who told you that?” asked the boy, startled.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class17">“Maktub,”</span><span class="class16"> said the old crystal merchant.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And he gave the boy his blessing.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The boy went to his room and packed his belongings. They filled three sacks. As he was leaving, he saw, in the corner of the room, his old shepherd’s pouch. It was bunched up, and he had hardly thought of it for a long time. As he took his <span id="page_64"/>jacket out of the pouch, thinking to give it to someone in the street, the two stones fell to the floor. Urim and Thummim.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">It made the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize how long it had been since he had thought of him. For nearly a year, he had been working incessantly, thinking only of putting aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Never stop dreaming,” the old king had said. “Follow the omens.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the strange sensation that the old king was nearby. He had worked hard for a year, and the omens were that it was time to go.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">I’m going to go back to doing just what I did before, the boy thought. Even though the sheep didn’t teach me to speak Arabic.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange city, and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world</span><span id="page_65" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it,” the old king had said.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image587.jpg" alt="" class="class33"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the old king hadn’t said anything about being robbed, or about endless deserts, or about people who know what their dreams are but don’t want to realize them. The old king hadn’t told him that the Pyramids were just a pile of stones, or that anyone could build one in his backyard. And he had forgotten to mention that, when you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before, you should buy it.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign couple, while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking tea from crystal glasses. It was more activity than usual for this time of the morning. From where he stood, he saw for the first time that the old merchant’s hair was very much like the hair of the old king. He remembered the smile of the candy seller, on his first day in Tangier, when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to go—that smile had also been like the old king’s smile.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">It’s almost as if he had been here and left his mark, he thought. And yet, none of these people has ever met the old king. On the other hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are trying to realize their Personal Legend</span><span id="page_66" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant. He didn’t want to cry with the other people there. He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned. He was more confident in himself, though, and felt as though he could conquer the world.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But I’m going back to the fields that I know, to take care of my flock again.” He said that to himself with certainty, but he was no longer happy with his decision. He had worked for an entire year to make a dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was becoming less important. Maybe because that wasn’t really his dream.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Who knows . . . maybe it’s better to be like the crystal merchant: never go to Mecca, and just go through life wanting to do so, he thought, again trying to convince himself. But as he held Urim and Thummim in his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and will of the old king. By coincidence—or maybe it was an omen, the boy thought—he came to the bar he had entered on his first day there. The thief wasn’t there, and the owner brought him a cup of tea.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">I can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought. I learned how to care for sheep, and I haven’t forgotten how that’s done. But maybe I’ll never have another chance to get to the Pyramids </span><span id="page_67" class="class16"/><span class="class16">in Egypt. The old man wore a breastplate of gold, and he knew about my past. He really was a king, a wise king.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The hills of Andalusia were only two hours away, but there was an entire desert between him and the Pyramids. Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation: he was actually two hours closer to his treasure . . . the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn’t matter.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">I know why I want to get back to my flock, he thought. I understand sheep; they’re no longer a problem, and they can be good friends. On the other hand, I don’t know if the desert can be a friend, and it’s in the desert that I have to search for my treasure. If I don’t find it, I can always go home. I finally have enough money, and all the time I need. Why not?</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He suddenly felt tremendously happy. He could always go back to being a shepherd. He could always become a crystal salesman again. Maybe the world had other hidden treasures, but he had a dream, and he had met with a king. That doesn’t happen to just anyone!</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He was planning as he left the bar. He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant’s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans </span><span id="page_68" class="class16"/><span class="class16">that crossed the desert. He held Urim and Thummim in his hand; because of those two stones, he was once again on the way to his treasure.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I am always nearby, when someone wants to realize their Personal Legend,” the old king had told him.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">What could it cost to go over to the supplier’s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away?</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The Englishman was sitting on a bench in a structure that smelled of animals, sweat, and dust; it was part warehouse, part corral. I never thought I’d end up in a place like this, he thought, as he leafed through the pages of a chemical journal. Ten years at the university, and here I am in a corral.</div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image606.jpg" alt="" class="class21"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But he had to move on. He believed in omens. All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the universe. First he had studied Esperanto, then the world’s religions, and now it was alchemy. He knew how to speak Esperanto, he understood all the major religions well, but he wasn’t yet an alchemist. He had unraveled the truths behind important questions, but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go. He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist. But the alchemists were strange people, who thought only </span><span id="page_69" class="class16"/><span class="class16">about themselves, and almost always refused to help him. Who knows, maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master Work—the Philosopher’s Stone—and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father, fruitlessly seeking the Philosopher’s Stone. He had spent enormous amounts of time at the great libraries of the world, and had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy. In one he had read that, many years ago, a famous Arabian alchemist had visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two hundred years old, and that he had discovered the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story. But he would never have thought it more than just a myth, had not a friend of his—returning from an archaeological expedition in the desert—told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis,” his friend had said. “And people say that he is two hundred years old, and is able to transform any metal into gold.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his books, and now here he was, sitting inside a dusty, smelly warehouse. Outside, a huge caravan was being prepared </span><span id="page_70" class="class16"/><span class="class16">for a crossing of the Sahara, and was scheduled to pass through Al-Fayoum.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">I’m going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman thought. And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">A young Arab, also loaded down with baggage, entered, and greeted the Englishman.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Where are you bound?” asked the young Arab.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m going into the desert,” the man answered, turning back to his reading. He didn’t want any conversation at this point. What he needed to do was review all he had learned over the years, because the alchemist would certainly put him to the test.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book was written in Spanish. That’s good, thought the Englishman. He spoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if this boy was going to Al-Fayoum, there would be someone to talk to when there were no other important things to do.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">“That’s strange,” said the boy, as he tried once again to read the burial scene that began the book. “I’ve been trying for two years to read this book, and I never get past these first few pages.” Even without a king to provide an interruption, he was unable to concentrate.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he was able to understand one </span><span id="page_71" class="class16"/><span class="class16">thing: making a decision was only the beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When I decided to seek out my treasure, I never imagined that I’d wind up working in a crystal shop, he thought. And joining this caravan may have been my decision, but where it goes is going to be a mystery to me.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Nearby was the Englishman, reading a book. He seemed unfriendly, and had looked irritated when the boy had entered. They might even have become friends, but the Englishman closed off the conversation.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy closed his book. He felt that he didn’t want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman. He took Urim and Thummim from his pocket, and began playing with them.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The stranger shouted, “Urim and Thummim!”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“They’re not for sale,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“They’re not worth much,” the Englishman answered. “They’re only made of rock crystal, and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth. But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim. I didn’t know that they had them in this part of the world.</span><span id="page_72" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“They were given to me as a present by a king,” the boy said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The stranger didn’t answer; instead, he put his hand in his pocket, and took out two stones that were the same as the boy’s.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Did you say a king?” he asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I guess you don’t believe that a king would talk to someone like me, a shepherd,” he said, wanting to end the conversation.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Not at all. It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a king that the rest of the world refused to acknowledge. So, it’s not surprising that kings would talk to shepherds.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And he went on, fearing that the boy wouldn’t understand what he was talking about, “It’s in the Bible. The same book that taught me about Urim and Thummim. These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God. The priests carried them in a golden breastplate.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Maybe this is an omen,” said the Englishman, half aloud.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Who told you about omens?” The boy’s interest was increasing by the moment.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Everything in life is an omen,” said the Englishman, now closing the journal he was reading. “There is a universal language, understood by </span><span id="page_73" class="class16"/><span class="class16">everybody, but already forgotten. I am in search of that universal language, among other things. That’s why I’m here. I have to find a man who knows that universal language. An alchemist.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You’re in luck, you two,” the fat Arab said. “There’s a caravan leaving today for Al-Fayoum.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But I’m going to Egypt,” the boy said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Al-Fayoum is in Egypt,” said the Arab. “What kind of Arab are you?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s a good luck omen,” the Englishman said, after the fat Arab had gone out. “If I could, I’d write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence. It’s with those words that the universal language is written.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with Urim and Thummim in his hand. And he asked the boy if he, too, were in search of the alchemist.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m looking for a treasure,” said the boy, and he immediately regretted having said it. But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“In a way, so am I,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I don’t even know what alchemy is,” the boy was saying, when the warehouse boss called to them to come outside.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" id="page_74" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">“I’m the leader of the caravan,” said a dark-eyed, bearded man. “I hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me. The desert is a capricious lady, and sometimes she drives men crazy.”</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">There were almost two hundred people gathered there, and four hundred animals—camels, horses, mules, and fowl. In the crowd were women, children, and a number of men with swords at their belts and rifles slung on their shoulders. The Englishman had several suitcases filled with books. There was a babble of noise, and the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image650.jpg" alt="" class="class34"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“There are a lot of different people here, and each has his own God. But the only God I serve is Allah, and in his name I swear that I will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert. But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what. In the desert, disobedience means death.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">There was a murmur from the crowd. Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God. The boy swore to Jesus Christ. The Englishman said nothing. And the murmur lasted longer than a simple </span><span id="page_75" class="class16"/><span class="class16">vow would have. The people were also praying to heaven for protection.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">A long note was sounded on a bugle, and everyone mounted up. The boy and the Englishman had bought camels, and climbed uncertainly onto their backs. The boy felt sorry for the Englishman’s camel, loaded down as he was with the cases of books.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“There’s no such thing as coincidence,” said the Englishman, picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the warehouse. “I’m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who . . .”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the caravan began to move, and it was impossible to hear what the Englishman was saying. The boy knew what he was about to describe, though: the mysterious chain that links one thing to another, the same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd, that had caused his recurring dream, that had brought him to a city near Africa, to find a king, and to be robbed in order to meet a crystal merchant, and . . .</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The closer one gets to realizing his Personal Legend, the more that Personal Legend becomes his true reason for being, thought the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The caravan moved toward the east. It traveled during the morning, halted when the sun was at its strongest, and resumed late in the afternoon. The </span><span id="page_76" class="class16"/><span class="class16">boy spoke very little with the Englishman, who spent most of his time with his books.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert. Now everything was quite different from how it was that day they had set out: then, there had been confusion and shouting, the cries of children and the whinnying of animals, all mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind, and of the hoofbeats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very little to one another.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’ve crossed these sands many times,” said one of the camel drivers one night. “But the desert is so huge, and the horizons so distant, that they make a person feel small, and as if he should remain silent.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever having set foot in the desert before. Whenever he saw the sea, or a fire, he fell silent, impressed by their elemental force.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">I’ve learned things from the sheep, and I’ve learned things from crystal, he thought. I can learn something from the desert, too. It seems old and wise.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face. It reminded </span><span id="page_77" class="class16"/><span class="class16">him of the wool from his sheep . . . his sheep who were now seeking food and water in the fields of Andalusia, as they always had.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“They’re not my sheep anymore,” he said to himself, without nostalgia. “They must be used to their new shepherd, and have probably already forgotten me. That’s good. Creatures like the sheep, that are used to traveling, know about moving on.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He thought of the merchant’s daughter, and was sure that she had probably married. Perhaps to a baker, or to another shepherd who could read and could tell her exciting stories—after all, he probably wasn’t the only one. But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver’s comment: maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the present of all people. “Hunches,” his mother used to call them. The boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and we are able to know everything, because it’s all written there.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class17">“Maktub,”</span><span class="class16"> the boy said, remembering the crystal merchant.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others. When the caravan was blocked by a boulder, it had to go around it; if there was a large rocky area, they had to make a major detour. If the sand was too fine for the animals’ hooves, they </span><span id="page_78" class="class16"/><span class="class16">sought a way where the sand was more substantial. In some places, the ground was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes. The animals balked at such places, and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden their charges. The drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels. If a guide were to fall ill or die, the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many detours and adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the same compass point. Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to its course, sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis. When the people saw that star shining in the morning sky, they knew they were on the right course toward water, palm trees, shelter, and other people. It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all this; he was, for the most part, immersed in reading his books.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image672.jpg" alt="" class="class28"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the first few days of the journey. But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had learned to know his camel better, and to establish a relationship with him, he threw the book away. Although the boy had developed a superstition </span><span id="page_79" class="class16"/><span class="class16">that each time he opened the book he would learn something important, he decided it was an unnecessary burden.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him. At night, as they sat around the fire, the boy related to the driver his adventures as a shepherd.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">During one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I used to live near El Cairum,” he said. “I had my orchard, my children, and a life that would change not at all until I died. One year, when the crop was the best ever, we all went to Mecca, and I satisfied the only unmet obligation in my life. I could die happily, and that made me feel good.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“One day, the earth began to tremble, and the Nile overflowed its banks. It was something that I thought could happen only to others, never to me. My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive trees in the flood, and my wife was afraid that we would lose our children. I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The land was ruined, and I had to find some other way to earn a living. So now I’m a camel driver. But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah: people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want</span><span id="page_80" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it’s our life or our possessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Sometimes, their caravan met with another. One always had something that the other needed—as if everything were indeed written by one hand. As they sat around the fire, the camel drivers exchanged information about windstorms, and told stories about the desert.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">At other times, mysterious, hooded men would appear; they were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route. They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes. They came in silence and departed the same way, dressed in black garments that showed only their eyes. One night, a camel driver came to the fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting. “There are rumors of tribal wars,” he told them.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The three fell silent. The boy noted that there was a sense of fear in the air, even though no one said anything. Once again he was experiencing the language without words . . . the universal language.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman asked if they were in danger.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Once you get into the desert, there’s no going back,” said the camel driver. “And, when you can’t go back, you have to worry only about the best way </span><span id="page_81" class="class16"/><span class="class16">of moving forward. The rest is up to Allah, including the danger.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And he concluded by saying the mysterious word: </span><span class="class17">“Maktub.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You should pay more attention to the caravan,” the boy said to the Englishman, after the camel driver had left. “We make a lot of detours, but we’re always heading for the same destination.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And you ought to read more about the world,” answered the Englishman. “Books are like caravans in that respect.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster. The days had always been silent, but now, even the nights—when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires—had also become quiet. And, one day, the leader of the caravan made the decision that the fires should no longer be lighted, so as not to attract attention to the caravan.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a circle at night, sleeping together in the center as protection against the nocturnal cold. And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman was unable to sleep one night. He called to the boy, and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment. There was a full moon, and the boy told the Englishman the story of his life</span><span id="page_82" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s the principle that governs all things,” he said. “In alchemy, it’s called the Soul of the World. When you want something with all your heart, that’s when you are closest to the Soul of the World. It’s always a positive force.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He also said that this was not just a human gift, that everything on the face of the earth had a soul, whether mineral, vegetable, or animal—or even just a simple thought.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Everything on earth is being continuously transformed, because the earth is alive . . . and it has a soul. We are part of that soul, so we rarely recognize that it is working for us. But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands. “I have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert,” he said. “The caravan and the desert speak the same language, and it’s for that reason that the desert allows the crossing. It’s going to test the caravan’s every step to see if it’s in time, and, if it is, we will make it to the oasis.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal courage, but without understanding </span><span id="page_83" class="class16"/><span class="class16">that language, this journey would have been much more difficult.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They stood there looking at the moon.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s the magic of omens,” said the boy. “I’ve seen how the guides read the signs of the desert, and how the soul of the caravan speaks to the soul of the desert.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman said, “I’d better pay more attention to the caravan.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And I’d better read your books,” said the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">They were strange books. They spoke about mercury, salt, dragons, and kings, and he didn’t understand any of it. But there was one idea that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books: all things are the manifestation of one thing only.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">In one of the books he learned that the most important text in the literature of alchemy contained only a few lines, and had been inscribed on the surface of an emerald.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s the Emerald Tablet,” said the Englishman, proud that he might teach something to the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, then, why do we need all these books?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“So that we can understand those few lines,” the Englishman answered, without appearing really to believe what he had said</span><span id="page_84" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists. They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories; they believed that, if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and what was left would be the Soul of the World. This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything on the face of the earth, because it was the language with which all things communicated. They called that discovery the Master Work—it was part liquid and part solid.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Can’t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You have a mania for simplifying everything,” answered the Englishman, irritated. “Alchemy is a serious discipline. Every step has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was called the Elixir of Life, and that it cured all illnesses; it also kept the alchemist from growing old. And the solid part was called the Philosopher’s Stone.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s not easy to find the Philosopher’s Stone,” said the Englishman. “The alchemists spent years in their laboratories, observing the fire that purified the metals. They spent so much time close to the </span><span id="page_85" class="class16"/><span class="class16">fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world. They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy thought about the crystal merchant. He had said that it was a good thing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces, so that he could free himself from negative thoughts. The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one’s daily life.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Also,” said the Englishman, “the Philosopher’s Stone has a fascinating property. A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Having heard that, the boy became even more interested in alchemy. He thought that, with some patience, he’d be able to transform everything into gold. He read the lives of the various people who had succeeded in doing so: Helvétius, Elias, Fulcanelli, and Geber. They were fascinating stories: each of them lived out his Personal Legend to the end. They traveled, spoke with wise men, performed miracles for the incredulous, and owned the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master Work, he became completely lost. There were just drawings, coded instructions, and obscure texts.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" id="page_86" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">“Why do they make things so complicated?” he asked the Englishman one night. The boy had noticed that the Englishman was irritable, and missed his books.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand,” he said. “Imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold. Gold would lose its value.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s only those who are persistent, and willing to study things deeply, who achieve the Master Work. That’s why I’m here in the middle of the desert. I’m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“When were these books written?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Many centuries ago.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“They didn’t have the printing press in those days,” the boy argued. “There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy. Why did they use such strange language, with so many drawings?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman didn’t answer him directly. He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan operated, but that he hadn’t learned anything new. The only thing he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" id="page_87" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">Then one day the boy returned the books to the Englishman. “Did you learn anything?” the Englishman asked, eager to hear what it might be. He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I learned that the world has a soul, and that whoever understands that soul can also understand the language of things. I learned that many alchemists realized their Personal Legends, and wound up discovering the Soul of the World, the Philosopher’s Stone, and the Elixir of Life.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But, above all, I learned that these things are all so simple that they could be written on the surface of an emerald.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman was disappointed. The years of research, the magic symbols, the strange words, and the laboratory equipment . . . none of this had made an impression on the boy. His soul must be too primitive to understand those things, he thought.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Go back to watching the caravan,” he said. “That didn’t teach me anything, either.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy went back to contemplating the silence of the desert, and the sand raised by the animals. “Everyone has his or her own way of learning </span><span id="page_88" class="class16"/><span class="class16">things,” he said to himself. “His way isn’t the same as mine, nor mine as his. But we’re both in search of our Personal Legends, and I respect him for that.”</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The caravan began to travel day and night. The hooded Bedouins reappeared more and more frequently, and the camel driver—who had become a good friend of the boy’s—explained that the war between the tribes had already begun. The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The animals were exhausted, and the men talked among themselves less and less. The silence was the worst aspect of the night, when the mere groan of a camel—which before had been nothing but the groan of a camel—now frightened everyone, because it might signal a raid.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The camel driver, though, seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m alive,” he said to the boy, as they ate a bunch of dates one night, with no fires and no moon. “When I’m eating, that’s all I think about. If I’m on the march, I just concentrate on marching. If I have to fight, it will be just as good a day to die as any other.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man. You’ll see that there is life in the desert, </span><span id="page_89" class="class16"/><span class="class16">that there are stars in the heavens, and that tribesmen fight because they are part of the human race. Life will be a party for you, a grand festival, because life is the moment we’re living right now.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Two nights later, as he was getting ready to bed down, the boy looked for the star they followed every night. He thought that the horizon was a bit lower than it had been, because he seemed to see stars on the desert itself.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s the oasis,” said the camel driver.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, why don’t we go there right now?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because we have to sleep.”</span></div>
<div class="class"><img src="image744.jpg" alt="" class="class21"/></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The boy awoke as the sun rose. There, in front of him, where the small stars had been the night before, was an endless row of date palms, stretching across the entire desert.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“We’ve done it!” said the Englishman, who had also awakened early.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the boy was quiet. He was at home with the silence of the desert, and he was content just to look at the trees. He still had a long way to go to reach the Pyramids, and someday this morning would just be a memory. But this was the present moment—the party the camel driver had mentioned—and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future. </span><span id="page_90" class="class16"/><span class="class16">Although the vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory, right now it signified shade, water, and a refuge from the war. Yesterday, the camel’s groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms could herald a miracle.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The world speaks many languages, the boy thought.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The times rush past, and so do the caravans, thought the alchemist, as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the oasis. People were shouting at the new arrivals, dust obscured the desert sun, and the children of the oasis were bursting with excitement at the arrival of the strangers. The alchemist saw the tribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan, and converse with him at length.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But none of that mattered to the alchemist. He had already seen many people come and go, and the desert remained as it was. He had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands. The dunes were changed constantly by the wind, yet these were the same sands he had known since he was a child. He always enjoyed seeing the happiness that the travelers experienced when, after weeks of yellow sand and blue sky, they first saw the green of the date </span><span id="page_91" class="class16"/><span class="class16">palms. Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date trees, he thought.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He decided to concentrate on more practical matters. He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets. The omens had told him so. He didn’t know the man yet, but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared. He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">I don’t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of mouth, he thought. It wasn’t exactly that they were secrets; God revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He had only one explanation for this fact: things have to be transmitted this way because they were made up from the pure life, and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Because people become fascinated with pictures and words, and wind up forgetting the Language of the World.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The boy couldn’t believe what he was seeing: the oasis, rather than being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees—as he had seen once in a geography book—was much larger than many towns back in Spain. There were three hundred <span id="page_92"/>wells, fifty thousand date trees, and innumerable colored tents spread among them.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It looks like </span><span class="class17">A Thousand and One Nights,</span><span class="class16">” said the Englishman, impatient to meet with the alchemist.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They were surrounded by children, curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving. The men of the oasis wanted to know if they had seen any fighting, and the women competed with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants. The silence of the desert was a distant dream; the travelers in the caravan were talking incessantly, laughing and shouting, as if they had emerged from the spiritual world and found themselves once again in the world of people. They were relieved and happy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always considered to be neutral territories, because the majority of the inhabitants were women and children. There were oases throughout the desert, but the tribesmen fought in the desert, leaving the oases as places of refuge.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">With some difficulty, the leader of the caravan brought all his people together and gave them his instructions. The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was over. Since they were visitors, they would have to share living space with those who lived there, and would </span><span id="page_93" class="class16"/><span class="class16">be given the best accommodations. That was the law of hospitality. Then he asked that everyone, including his own sentinels, hand over their arms to the men appointed by the tribal chieftains.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Those are the rules of war,” the leader explained. “The oases may not shelter armies or troops.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">To the boy’s surprise, the Englishman took a chrome-plated revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image768.jpg" alt="" class="class21"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why a revolver?” he asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It helped me to trust in people,” the Englishman answered.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Meanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure. The closer he got to the realization of his dream, the more difficult things became. It seemed as if what the old king had called “beginner’s luck” were no longer functioning. In his pursuit of the dream, he was being constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage. So he could not be hasty, nor impatient. If he pushed forward impulsively, he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">God placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with the thought. Until then, he had considered the omens to be things of this world. Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a job. He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do</span><span id="page_94" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Don’t be impatient,” he repeated to himself. “It’s like the camel driver said: ‘Eat when it’s time to eat. And move along when it’s time to move along.’”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">That first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the Englishman. The boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a tent with five other young men of about his age. They were people of the desert, and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’ve been looking for you all morning,” he said, as he led the boy outside. “I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">First, they tried to find him on their own. An alchemist would probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the people at the oasis, and it was likely that in his tent an oven was continuously burning. They searched everywhere, and found that the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined; there were hundreds of tents.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“We’ve wasted almost the entire day,” said the Englishman, sitting down with the boy near one of the wells</span><span id="page_95" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Maybe we’d better ask someone,” the boy suggested.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman didn’t want to tell others about his reasons for being at the oasis, and couldn’t make up his mind. But, finally, he agreed that the boy, who spoke better Arabic than he, should do so. The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Good afternoon, ma’am. I’m trying to find out where the alchemist lives here at the oasis.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The woman said she had never heard of such a person, and hurried away. But before she fled, she advised the boy that he had better not try to converse with women who were dressed in black, because they were married women. He should respect tradition.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman was disappointed. It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing. The boy was also saddened; his friend was in pursuit of his Personal Legend. And, when someone was in such pursuit, the entire universe made an effort to help him succeed—that’s what the old king had said. He couldn’t have been wrong.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I had never heard of alchemists before,” the boy said. “Maybe no one here has, either.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman’s eyes lit up. “That’s it! Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is! Find out who it is who cures the people’s illnesses!</span><span id="page_96" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Several women dressed in black came to the well for water, but the boy would speak to none of them, despite the Englishman’s insistence. Then a man approached.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Do you know someone here who cures people’s illnesses?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Allah cures our illnesses,” said the man, clearly frightened of the strangers. “You’re looking for witch doctors.” He spoke some verses from the Koran, and moved on.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image791.jpg" alt="" class="class21"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Another man appeared. He was older, and was carrying a small bucket. The boy repeated his question.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why do you want to find that sort of person?” the Arab asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to meet with him,” the boy said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“If such a man is here at the oasis, he must be the very powerful one,” said the old man after thinking for a few moments. “Not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to. Only when he consents.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Wait for the end of the war. Then leave with the caravan. Don’t try to enter into the life of the oasis,” he said, and walked away.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. She had a vessel on her shoulder, </span><span id="page_97" class="class16"/><span class="class16">and her head was covered by a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him. When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke—the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at the well. She smiled, and that was certainly an omen—the omen he had been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life. The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">It was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time. What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. He was more certain of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed. But </span><span id="page_98" class="class16"/><span class="class16">maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language. Because, when you know that language, it’s easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether it’s in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such love, one’s dreams would have no meaning.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class17">Maktub,</span><span class="class16"> thought the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman shook the boy: “Come on, ask her!”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy stepped closer to the girl, and when she smiled, he did the same.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What’s your name?” he asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Fatima,” the girl said, averting her eyes.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s what some women in my country are called.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s the name of the Prophet’s daughter,” Fatima said. “The invaders carried the name everywhere.” The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the man who cured people’s illnesses</span><span id="page_99" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s the man who knows all the secrets of the world,” she said. “He communicates with the genies of the desert.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The genies were the spirits of good and evil. And the girl pointed to the south, indicating that it was there the strange man lived. Then she filled her vessel with water and left.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Englishman vanished, too, gone to find the alchemist. And the boy sat there by the well for a long time, remembering that one day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that woman, and realizing that he had loved her before he even knew she existed. He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl. To his surprise, the Englishman was there, looking out at the desert.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image815.jpg" alt="" class="class29"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I waited all afternoon and evening,” he said. “He appeared with the first stars of evening. I told him what I was seeking, and he asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold. I told him that was what I had come here to learn.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“He told me I should try to do so. That’s all he said: ‘Go and try.’”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy didn’t say anything. The poor Englishman had traveled all this way, only to be told that </span><span id="page_100" class="class16"/><span class="class16">he should repeat what he had already done so many times.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“So, then try,” he said to the Englishman.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to start now.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">As the Englishman left, Fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I came to tell you just one thing,” the boy said. “I want you to be my wife. I love you.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The girl dropped the container, and the water spilled.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m going to wait here for you every day. I have crossed the desert in search of a treasure that is somewhere near the Pyramids, and for me, the war seemed a curse. But now it’s a blessing, because it brought me to you.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The war is going to end someday,” the girl said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy looked around him at the date palms. He reminded himself that he had been a shepherd, and that he could be a shepherd again. Fatima was more important than his treasure.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The tribesmen are always in search of treasure,” the girl said, as if she had guessed what he was thinking. “And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">She refilled her vessel and left.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima. He told her about his life as a shepherd, about the king, and about the crystal shop. They </span><span id="page_101" class="class16"/><span class="class16">became friends, and except for the fifteen minutes he spent with her, each day seemed that it would never pass. When he had been at the oasis for almost a month, the leader of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“We don’t know when the war will end, so we can’t continue our journey,” he said. “The battles may last for a long time, perhaps even years. There are powerful forces on both sides, and the war is important to both armies. It’s not a battle of good against evil. It’s a war between forces that are fighting for the balance of power, and, when that type of battle begins, it lasts longer than others—because Allah is on both sides.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The people went back to where they were living, and the boy went to meet with Fatima that afternoon. He told her about the morning’s meeting. “The day after we met,” Fatima said, “you told me that you loved me. Then, you taught me something of the universal language and the Soul of the World. Because of that, I have become a part of you.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy listened to the sound of her voice, and thought it to be more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time. I have forgotten about my past, about my traditions, and the way in which men of the desert expect women to behave. Ever since I was a </span><span id="page_102" class="class16"/><span class="class16">child, I have dreamed that the desert would bring me a wonderful present. Now, my present has arrived, and it’s you.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy wanted to take her hand. But Fatima’s hands held to the handles of her jug.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You have told me about your dreams, about the old king and your treasure. And you’ve told me about omens. So now, I fear nothing, because it was those omens that brought you to me. And I am a part of your dream, a part of your Personal Legend, as you call it.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s why I want you to continue toward your goal. If you have to wait until the war is over, then wait. But if you have to go before then, go on in pursuit of your dream. The dunes are changed by the wind, but the desert never changes. That’s the way it will be with our love for each other.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class17">“Maktub,”</span><span class="class16"> she said. “If I am really a part of your dream, you’ll come back one day.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was sad as he left her that day. He thought of all the married shepherds he had known. They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields. Love required them to stay with the people they loved.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He told Fatima that, at their next meeting.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The desert takes our men from us, and they don’t always return,” she said. “We know that, and we are used to it. Those who don’t return become a part of the clouds, a part of the animals that hide </span><span id="page_103" class="class16"/><span class="class16">in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth. They become a part of everything . . . they become the Soul of the World.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Some do come back. And then the other women are happy because they believe that their men may one day return, as well. I used to look at those women and envy them their happiness. Now, I too will be one of the women who wait.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m a desert woman, and I’m proud of that. I want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes. And, if I have to, I will accept the fact that he has become a part of the clouds, and the animals, and the water of the desert.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy went to look for the Englishman. He wanted to tell him about Fatima. He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman had built himself a furnace outside his tent. It was a strange furnace, fueled by firewood, with a transparent flask heating on top. As the Englishman stared out at the desert, his eyes seemed brighter than they had when he was reading his books.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“This is the first phase of the job,” he said. “I have to separate out the sulfur. To do that successfully, I must have no fear of failure. It was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master Work. Now, I’m beginning what I could have started ten years ago. But I’m happy at least that I didn’t wait twenty years.</span><span id="page_104" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He continued to feed the fire, and the boy stayed on until the desert turned pink in the setting sun. He felt the urge to go out into the desert, to see if its silence held the answers to his questions.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight. He listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his feet. Here and there, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in remote times, had been a sea. He sat on a stone, and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon. He tried to deal with the concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldn’t separate them. But Fatima was a woman of the desert, and, if anything could help him to understand, it was the desert.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">As he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him. Looking up, he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind. Although their flight appeared to have no pattern, it made a certain kind of sense to the boy. It was just that he couldn’t grasp what it meant. He followed the movement of the birds, trying to read something into it. Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image851.jpg" alt="" class="class28"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He felt sleepy. In his heart, he wanted to remain awake, but he also wanted to sleep. “I am learning </span><span id="page_105" class="class16"/><span class="class16">the Language of the World, and everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me . . . even the flight of the hawks,” he said to himself. And, in that mood, he was grateful to be in love. When you are in love, things make even more sense, he thought.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Suddenly, one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky, attacking the other. As it did so, a sudden, fleeting image came to the boy: an army, with its swords at the ready, riding into the oasis. The vision vanished immediately, but it had shaken him. He had heard people speak of mirages, and had already seen some himself: they were desires that, because of their intensity, materialized over the sands of the desert. But he certainly didn’t desire that an army invade the oasis.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his meditation. He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert, and its stones. But there was something there in his heart that wouldn’t allow him to do so.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Always heed the omens,” the old king had said. The boy recalled what he had seen in the vision, and sensed that it was actually going to occur.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He rose, and made his way back toward the palm trees. Once again, he perceived the many languages in the things about him: this time, the desert was safe, and it was the oasis that had become dangerous</span><span id="page_106" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree, observing the sunset. He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“An army is coming,” the boy said. “I had a vision.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The desert fills men’s hearts with visions,” the camel driver answered.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the boy told him about the hawks: that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The camel driver understood what the boy was saying. He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history of all things. One could open a book to any page, or look at a person’s hand; one could turn a card, or watch the flight of the birds . . . whatever the thing observed, one could find a connection with his experience of the moment. Actually, it wasn’t that those things, in themselves, revealed anything at all; it was just that people, looking at what was occurring around them, could find a means of penetration to the Soul of the World.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World. They were known as seers, and they were held in fear by women and the elderly. Tribesmen were also wary of consulting them, because it would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was fated to die. </span><span id="page_107" class="class16"/><span class="class16">The tribesmen preferred the taste of battle, and the thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be; the future was already written by Allah, and what he had written was always for the good of man. So the tribesmen lived only for the present, because the present was full of surprises, and they had to be aware of many things: Where was the enemy’s sword? Where was his horse? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive? The camel driver was not a fighter, and he had consulted with seers. Many of them had been right about what they said, while some had been wrong. Then, one day, the oldest seer he had ever sought out (and the one most to be feared) had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well . . . so I can do things,” he had responded. “And so I can change those things that I don’t want to happen.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But then they wouldn’t be a part of your future,” the seer had said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, maybe I just want to know the future so I can prepare myself for what’s coming.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“If good things are coming, they will be a pleasant surprise,” said the seer. “If bad things are, and you know in advance, you will suffer greatly before they even occur.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I want to know about the future because I’m a man,” the camel driver had said to the seer. “And men always live their lives based on the future.</span><span id="page_108" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs; he threw them on the ground, and made interpretations based on how they fell. That day, he didn’t make a cast. He wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put them back in his bag.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I make my living forecasting the future for people,” he said. “I know the science of the twigs, and I know how to use them to penetrate to the place where all is written. There, I can read the past, discover what has already been forgotten, and understand the omens that are here in the present.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“When people consult me, it’s not that I’m reading the future; I am guessing at the future. The future belongs to God, and it is only he who reveals it, under extraordinary circumstances. How do I guess at the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better. Forget about the future, and live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Only when he, himself, reveals it. And God only rarely reveals the future. When he does so, it is </span><span id="page_109" class="class16"/><span class="class16">for only one reason: it’s a future that was written so as to be altered.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">God had shown the boy a part of the future, the camel driver thought. Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument?</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Go and speak to the tribal chieftains,” said the camel driver. “Tell them about the armies that are approaching.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“They’ll laugh at me.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“They are men of the desert, and the men of the desert are used to dealing with omens.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, then, they probably already know.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“They’re not concerned with that right now. They believe that if they have to know about something Allah wants them to know, someone will tell them about it. It has happened many times before. But, this time, the person is you.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy thought of Fatima. And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The boy approached the guard at the front of the huge white tent at the center of the oasis.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I want to see the chieftains. I’ve brought omens from the desert.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Without responding, the guard entered the tent, where he remained for some time. When he emerged, it was with a young Arab, dressed in </span><span id="page_110" class="class16"/><span class="class16">white and gold. The boy told the younger man what he had seen, and the man asked him to wait there. He disappeared into the tent.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Night fell, and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent. One by one, the campfires were extinguished, and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert. Only the lights in the great tent remained. During all this time, the boy thought about Fatima, and he was still unable to understand his last conversation with her.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Finally, after hours of waiting, the guard bade the boy enter. The boy was astonished by what he saw inside. Never could he have imagined that, there in the middle of the desert, there existed a tent like this one. The ground was covered with the most beautiful carpets he had ever walked upon, and from the top of the structure hung lamps of handwrought gold, each with a lighted candle. The tribal chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle, resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions. Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea. Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs. The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">There were eight chieftains, but the boy could see immediately which of them was the most important: an Arab dressed in white and gold, seated </span><span id="page_111" class="class16"/><span class="class16">at the center of the semicircle. At his side was the young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image889.jpg" alt="" class="class28"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Who is this stranger who speaks of omens?” asked one of the chieftains, eyeing the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It is I,” the boy answered. And he told what he had seen.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why would the desert reveal such things to a stranger, when it knows that we have been here for generations?” said another of the chieftains.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert,” the boy said. “I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And also because I know about the Soul of the World, he thought to himself.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The oasis is neutral ground. No one attacks an oasis,” said a third chieftain.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I can only tell you what I saw. If you don’t want to believe me, you don’t have to do anything about it.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The men fell into an animated discussion. They spoke in an Arabic dialect that the boy didn’t understand, but, when he made to leave, the guard told him to stay. The boy became fearful; the omens told him that something was wrong. He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Suddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly, and the boy felt better. The man </span><span id="page_112" class="class16"/><span class="class16">hadn’t participated in the discussion, and, in fact, hadn’t said a word up to that point. But the boy was already used to the Language of the World, and he could feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent. Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The discussion ended. The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying. Then he turned to the boy: this time his expression was cold and distant.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Two thousand years ago, in a distant land, a man who believed in dreams was thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave,” the old man said, now in the dialect the boy understood. “Our merchants bought that man, and brought him to Egypt. All of us know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The elder continued, “When the pharaoh dreamed of cows that were thin and cows that were fat, this man I’m speaking of rescued Egypt from famine. His name was Joseph. He, too, was a stranger in a strange land, like you, and he was probably about your age.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He paused, and his eyes were still unfriendly.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“We always observe the Tradition. The Tradition saved Egypt from famine in those days, and made the Egyptians the wealthiest of peoples. The Tradition teaches men how to cross the desert, and how their children should marry. The Tradition says </span><span id="page_113" class="class16"/><span class="class16">that an oasis is neutral territory, because both sides have oases, and so both are vulnerable.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">No one said a word as the old man continued.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert. Everything we know was taught to us by the desert.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The old man gave a signal, and everyone stood. The meeting was over. The hookahs were extinguished, and the guards stood at attention. The boy made ready to leave, but the old man spoke again:</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Tomorrow, we are going to break the agreement that says that no one at the oasis may carry arms. Throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies. When the sun sets, the men will once again surrender their arms to me. For every ten dead men among our enemies, you will receive a piece of gold.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle. Arms are as capricious as the desert, and, if they are not used, the next time they might not function. If at least one of them hasn’t been used by the end of the day tomorrow, one will be used on you.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When the boy left the tent, the oasis was illuminated only by the light of the full moon. He was twenty minutes from his tent, and began to make his way there.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He was alarmed by what had happened. He had succeeded in reaching through to the Soul of the </span><span id="page_114" class="class16"/><span class="class16">World, and now the price for having done so might be his life. It was a frightening bet. But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to pursue his Personal Legend. And, as the camel driver had said, to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day. Every day was there to be lived or to mark one’s departure from this world. Everything depended on one word: </span><span class="class17">“Maktub.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Walking along in the silence, he had no regrets. If he died tomorrow, it would be because God was not willing to change the future. He would at least have died after having crossed the strait, after having worked in a crystal shop, and after having known the silence of the desert and Fatima’s eyes. He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago. If he died tomorrow, he would already have seen more than other shepherds, and he was proud of that.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Suddenly he heard a thundering sound, and he was thrown to the ground by a wind such as he had never known. The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view. Before him was an enormous white horse, rearing over him with a frightening scream.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at what he saw. Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in black, with a falcon perched on his left shoulder. He wore a turban </span><span id="page_115" class="class16"/><span class="class16">and his entire face, except for his eyes, was covered with a black kerchief. He appeared to be a messenger from the desert, but his presence was much more powerful than that of a mere messenger.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image916.jpg" alt="" class="class33"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle. The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks?” he demanded, so loudly that his words seemed to echo through the fifty thousand palm trees of Al-Fayoum.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It is I who dared to do so,” said the boy. He was reminded of the image of Santiago Matamoros, mounted on his white horse, with the infidels beneath his hooves. This man looked exactly the same, except that now the roles were reversed.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It is I who dared to do so,” he repeated, and he lowered his head to receive a blow from the sword. “Many lives will be saved, because I was able to see through to the Soul of the World.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The sword didn’t fall. Instead, the stranger lowered it slowly, until the point touched the boy’s forehead. It drew a droplet of blood.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The horseman was completely immobile, as was the boy. It didn’t even occur to the boy to flee. In his heart, he felt a strange sense of joy: he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend. And for </span><span id="page_116" class="class16"/><span class="class16">Fatima. The omens had been true, after all. Here he was, face-to-face with his enemy, but there was no need to be concerned about dying—the Soul of the World awaited him, and he would soon be a part of it. And, tomorrow, his enemy would also be a part of that Soul.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy’s forehead. “Why did you read the flight of the birds?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I read only what the birds wanted to tell me. They wanted to save the oasis. Tomorrow all of you will die, because there are more men at the oasis than you have.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The sword remained where it was. “Who are you to change what Allah has willed?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Allah created the armies, and he also created the hawks. Allah taught me the language of the birds. Everything has been written by the same hand,” the boy said, remembering the camel driver’s words.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The stranger withdrew the sword from the boy’s forehead, and the boy felt immensely relieved. But he still couldn’t flee.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Be careful with your prognostications,” said the stranger. “When something is written, there is no way to change it.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“All I saw was an army,” said the boy. “I didn’t see the outcome of the battle.</span><span id="page_117" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer. But he kept the sword in his hand. “What is a stranger doing in a strange land?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I am following my Personal Legend. It’s not something you would understand.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The stranger placed his sword in its scabbard, and the boy relaxed.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I had to test your courage,” the stranger said. “Courage is the quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was surprised. The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You must not let up, even after having come so far,” he continued. “You must love the desert, but never trust it completely. Because the desert tests all men: it challenges every step, and kills those who become distracted.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">What he said reminded the boy of the old king.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“If the warriors come here, and your head is still on your shoulders at sunset, come and find me,” said the stranger.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip. The horse reared again, raising a cloud of dust.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Where do you live?” shouted the boy, as the horseman rode away.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The hand with the whip pointed to the south.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy had met the alchemist.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" id="page_118" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">Next morning, there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at Al-Fayoum. Before the sun had reached its high point, five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon. The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north; it appeared to be a peaceful expedition, but they all carried arms hidden in their robes. When they reached the white tent at the center of Al-Fayoum, they withdrew their scimitars and rifles. And they attacked an empty tent.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead. The children had been kept at the other side of a grove of palm trees, and saw nothing of what had happened. The women had remained in their tents, praying for the safekeeping of their husbands, and saw nothing of the battle, either. Were it not for the bodies there on the ground, it would have appeared to be a normal day at the oasis.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion. That afternoon, he was brought before the tribal chieftains, who asked him why he had violated the Tradition. The commander said that his men had been starving and thirsty, exhausted from many days of battle, and had decided to take the oasis so as to be able to return to the war</span><span id="page_119" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen, but that the Tradition was sacred. He condemned the commander to death without honor. Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet, he was hanged from a dead palm tree, where his body twisted in the desert wind.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The tribal chieftain called for the boy, and presented him with fifty pieces of gold. He repeated his story about Joseph of Egypt, and asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">When the sun had set, and the first stars made their appearance, the boy started to walk to the south. He eventually sighted a single tent, and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies. But the boy sat down and waited.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view. He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I am here,” the boy said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You shouldn’t be here,” the alchemist answered. “Or is it your Personal Legend that brings you here?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“With the wars between the tribes, it’s impossible to cross the desert. So I have come here.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist dismounted from his horse, and signaled that the boy should enter the tent with him. It was a tent like many at the oasis. The boy </span><span id="page_120" class="class16"/><span class="class16">looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy, but saw none. There were only some books in a pile, a small cooking stove, and the carpets, covered with mysterious designs.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Sit down. We’ll have something to drink and eat these hawks,” said the alchemist.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen on the day before, but he said nothing. The alchemist lighted the fire, and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent. It was better than the scent of the hookahs.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why did you want to see me?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because of the omens,” the alchemist answered. “The wind told me you would be coming, and that you would need help.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s not I the wind spoke about. It’s the other foreigner, the Englishman. He’s the one that’s looking for you.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“He has other things to do first. But he’s on the right track. He has begun to try to understand the desert.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And what about me?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“When a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream,” said the alchemist, echoing the words of the old king. The boy understood. Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“So you are going to instruct </span><span id="page_121" class="class16"/><span class="class16">me?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“No. You already know all you need to know. I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But there’s a tribal war,” the boy reiterated.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I know what’s happening in the desert.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I have already found my treasure. I have a camel, I have my money from the crystal shop, and I have fifty gold pieces. In my own country, I would be a rich man.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But none of that is from the Pyramids,” said the alchemist.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I also have Fatima. She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“She wasn’t found at the Pyramids, either.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They ate in silence. The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy’s cup. It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Isn’t wine prohibited here?” the boy asked</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s not what enters men’s mouths that’s evil,” said the alchemist. “It’s what comes out of their mouths that is.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist was a bit daunting, but, as the boy drank the wine, he relaxed. After they finished eating they sat outside the tent, under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Drink and enjoy yourself,” said the alchemist, noticing that the boy was feeling happier. “Rest well tonight, as if you were a warrior preparing for </span><span id="page_122" class="class16"/><span class="class16">combat. Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure. You’ve got to find the treasure, so that everything you have learned along the way can make sense.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Tomorrow, sell your camel and buy a horse. Camels are traitorous: they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire. Then suddenly, they kneel and die. But horses tire bit by bit. You always know how much you can ask of them, and when it is that they are about to die.”</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The following night, the boy appeared at the alchemist’s tent with a horse. The alchemist was ready, and he mounted his own steed and placed the falcon on his left shoulder. He said to the boy, “Show me where there is life out in the desert. Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure.”</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They began to ride out over the sands, with the moon lighting their way. I don’t know if I’ll be able to find life in the desert, the boy thought. I don’t know the desert that well yet.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He wanted to say so to the alchemist, but he was afraid of the man. They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the hawks in the sky, but now there was only silence and the wind</span><span id="page_123" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I don’t know how to find life in the desert,” the boy said. “I know that there is life here, but I don’t know where to look.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Life attracts life,” the alchemist answered.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And then the boy understood. He loosened the reins on his horse, who galloped forward over the rocks and sand. The alchemist followed as the boy’s horse ran for almost half an hour. They could no longer see the palms of the oasis—only the gigantic moon above them, and its silver reflections from the stones of the desert. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the boy’s horse began to slow.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“There’s life here,” the boy said to the alchemist. “I don’t know the language of the desert, but my horse knows the language of life.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They dismounted, and the alchemist said nothing. Advancing slowly, they searched among the stones. The alchemist stopped abruptly, and bent to the ground. There was a hole there among the stones. The alchemist put his hand into the hole, and then his entire arm, up to his shoulder. Something was moving there, and the alchemist’s eyes—the boy could see only his eyes—squinted with his effort. His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole. Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his arm and leaped to his feet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail</span><span id="page_124" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist. The snake fought frantically, making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert. It was a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in minutes.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Watch out for his venom,” the boy said. But even though the alchemist had put his hand in the hole, and had surely already been bitten, his expression was calm. “The alchemist is two hundred years old,” the Englishman had told him. He must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and withdrew a scimitar. With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and then he placed the snake within it. The serpent relaxed immediately.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image991.jpg" alt="" class="class35"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Not to worry,” said the alchemist. “He won’t leave the circle. You found life in the desert, the omen that I needed.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why was that so important?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert.” The boy didn’t want to talk about the Pyramids. His heart was heavy, and he had been melancholy since the previous night. To continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m going to guide you across the desert,” the alchemist said</span><span id="page_125" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I want to stay at the oasis,” the boy answered. “I’ve found Fatima, and, as far as I’m concerned, she’s worth more than treasure.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Fatima is a woman of the desert,” said the alchemist. “She knows that men have to go away in order to return. And she already has her treasure: it’s you. Now she expects that you will find what it is you’re looking for.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, what if I decide to stay?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Let me tell you what will happen. You’ll be the counselor of the oasis. You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels. You’ll marry Fatima, and you’ll both be happy for a year. You’ll learn to love the desert, and you’ll get to know every one of the fifty thousand palms. You’ll watch them as they grow, demonstrating how the world is always changing. And you’ll get better and better at understanding omens, because the desert is the best teacher there is.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Sometime during the second year, you’ll remember about the treasure. The omens will begin insistently to speak of it, and you’ll try to ignore them. You’ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants. The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do. And your camels will bring you wealth and power.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“During the third year, the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your Personal Legend. You’ll </span><span id="page_126" class="class16"/><span class="class16">walk around, night after night, at the oasis, and Fatima will be unhappy because she’ll feel it was she who interrupted your quest. But you will love her, and she’ll return your love. You’ll remember that she never asked you to stay, because a woman of the desert knows that she must await her man. So you won’t blame her. But many times you’ll walk the sands of the desert, thinking that maybe you could have left . . . that you could have trusted more in your love for Fatima. Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back. At that point, the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Then, sometime during the fourth year, the omens will abandon you, because you’ve stopped listening to them. The tribal chieftains will see that, and you’ll be dismissed from your position as counselor. But, by then, you’ll be a rich merchant, with many camels and a great deal of merchandise. You’ll spend the rest of your days knowing that you didn’t pursue your Personal Legend, and that now it’s too late.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his Personal Legend. If he abandons that pursuit, it’s because it wasn’t true love . . . the love that speaks the Language of the World.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist erased the circle in the sand, and the snake slithered away among the rocks. The boy </span><span id="page_127" class="class16"/><span class="class16">remembered the crystal merchant who had always wanted to go to Mecca, and the Englishman in search of the alchemist. He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert. And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They mounted their horses, and this time it was the boy who followed the alchemist back to the oasis. The wind brought the sounds of the oasis to them, and the boy tried to hear Fatima’s voice.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But that night, as he had watched the cobra within the circle, the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of love and treasure, of the women of the desert and of his Personal Legend.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m going with you,” the boy said. And he immediately felt peace in his heart.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“We’ll leave tomorrow before sunrise,” was the alchemist’s only response.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The boy spent a sleepless night. Two hours before dawn, he awoke one of the boys who slept in his tent, and asked him to show him where Fatima lived. They went to her tent, and the boy gave his friend enough gold to buy a sheep.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was sleeping, and to awaken her and tell her that he was waiting outside. The young </span><span id="page_128" class="class16"/><span class="class16">Arab did as he was asked, and was given enough gold to buy yet another sheep.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Now leave us alone,” said the boy to the young Arab. The Arab returned to his tent to sleep, proud to have helped the counselor of the oasis, and happy at having enough money to buy himself some sheep.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent. The two walked out among the palms. The boy knew that it was a violation of the Tradition, but that didn’t matter to him now.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m going away,” he said. “And I want you to know that I’m coming back. I love you because . . .”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Don’t say anything,” Fatima interrupted. “One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the boy continued, “I had a dream, and I met with a king. I sold crystal and crossed the desert. And, because the tribes declared war, I went to the well, seeking the alchemist. So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The two embraced. It was the first time either had touched the other.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’ll be back,” the boy said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Before this, I always looked to the desert with longing,” said Fatima. “Now it will be with hope. My father went away one day, but he returned to </span><span id="page_129" class="class16"/><span class="class16">my mother, and he has always come back since then.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They said nothing else. They walked a bit farther among the palms, and then the boy left her at the entrance to her tent.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’ll return, just as your father came back to your mother,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He saw that Fatima’s eyes were filled with tears.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You’re crying?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m a woman of the desert,” she said, averting her face. “But above all, I’m a woman.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Fatima went back to her tent, and, when daylight came, she went out to do the chores she had done for years. But everything had changed. The boy was no longer at the oasis, and the oasis would never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday. It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three hundred wells, where the pilgrims arrived, relieved at the end of their long journeys. From that day on, the oasis would be an empty place for her.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">From that day on, it was the desert that would be important. She would look to it every day, and would try to guess which star the boy was following in search of his treasure. She would have to send her kisses on the wind, hoping that the wind would touch the boy’s face, and would tell him that she was alive. That she was waiting for him, a </span><span id="page_130" class="class16"/><span class="class16">woman awaiting a courageous man in search of his treasure. From that day on, the desert would represent only one thing to her: the hope for his return.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">“Don’t think about what you’ve left behind,” the alchemist said to the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert. “Everything is written in the Soul of the World, and there it will stay forever.”</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Men dream more about coming home than about leaving,” the boy said. He was already reaccustomed to the desert’s silence.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can always come back. If what you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The man was speaking the language of alchemy. But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image1035.jpg" alt="" class="class36"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind. The desert, with its endless monotony, put him to dreaming. The boy could still see the palm trees, the wells, and the face of the woman he loved. He could see the Englishman at his experiments, and the camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it. Maybe the alchemist has never been in love, the boy thought</span><span id="page_131" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist rode in front, with the falcon on his shoulder. The bird knew the language of the desert well, and whenever they stopped, he flew off in search of game. On the first day he returned with a rabbit, and on the second with two birds.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">At night, they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden. The desert nights were cold, and were becoming darker and darker as the phases of the moon passed. They went on for a week, speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to avoid the battles between the tribes. The war continued, and at times the wind carried the sweet, sickly smell of blood. Battles had been fought nearby, and the wind reminded the boy that there was the language of omens, always ready to show him what his eyes had failed to observe.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">On the seventh day, the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual. The falcon flew off to find game, and the alchemist offered his water container to the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You are almost at the end of your journey,” said the alchemist. “I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And you’ve told me nothing along the way,” said the boy. “I thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know. A while ago, I rode through the desert with a man who had </span><span id="page_132" class="class16"/><span class="class16">books on alchemy. But I wasn’t able to learn anything from them.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“There is only one way to learn,” the alchemist answered. “It’s through action. Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey. You need to learn only one thing more.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy wanted to know what that was, but the alchemist was searching the horizon, looking for the falcon.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why are you called the alchemist?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because that’s what I am.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“They were looking only for gold,” his companion answered. “They were seeking the treasure of their Personal Legend, without wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What is it that I still need to know?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon. And finally the falcon returned with their meal. They dug a hole and lit their fire in it, so that the light of the flames would not be seen.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m an alchemist simply because I’m an alchemist,” he said, as he prepared the meal. “I learned the science from my grandfather, who learned from his father, and so on, back to the creation of the world. In those times, the Master Work could be written simply on an emerald. But men began to reject </span><span id="page_133" class="class16"/><span class="class16">simple things, and to write tracts, interpretations, and philosophical studies. They also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had. Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What was written on the Emerald Tablet?” the boy wanted to know.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist began to draw in the sand, and completed his drawing in less than five minutes. As he drew, the boy thought of the old king, and the plaza where they had met that day; it seemed as if it had taken place years and years ago.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“This is what was written on the Emerald Tablet,” said the alchemist, when he had finished.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy tried to read what was written in the sand.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s a code,” said the boy, a bit disappointed. “It looks like what I saw in the Englishman’s books.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“No,” the alchemist answered. “It’s like the flight of those two hawks; it can’t be understood by reason alone. The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise. The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect. God created the world so that, through its visible objects, men could understand his spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom. That’s what I mean by action.</span><span id="page_134" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Should I understand the Emerald Tablet?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Perhaps, if you were in a laboratory of alchemy, this would be the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet. But you are in the desert. So immerse yourself in it. The desert will give you an understanding of the world; in fact, anything on the face of the earth will do that. You don’t even have to understand the desert: all you have to do is contemplate a simple grain of sand, and you will see in it all the marvels of creation.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“How do I immerse myself in the desert?”</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image1064.jpg" alt="" class="class37"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of the World, and it will one day return there.”</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">They crossed the desert for another two days in silence. The alchemist had become much more cautious, because they were approaching the area where the most violent battles were being waged. As they moved along, the boy tried to listen to his heart.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">It was not easy to do; in earlier times, his heart had always been ready to tell its story, but lately that wasn’t true. There had been times when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness, and at other times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears. His heart </span><span id="page_135" class="class16"/><span class="class16">beat fastest when it spoke to the boy of treasure, and more slowly when the boy stared entranced at the endless horizons of the desert. But his heart was never quiet, even when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why do we have to listen to our hearts?” the boy asked, when they had made camp that day.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you’ll find your treasure.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But my heart is agitated,” the boy said. “It has its dreams, it gets emotional, and it’s become passionate over a woman of the desert. It asks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when I’m thinking about her.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, that’s good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has to say.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">During the next three days, the two travelers passed by a number of armed tribesmen, and saw others on the horizon. The boy’s heart began to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard from the Soul of the World, stories of men who sought to find their treasure and never succeeded. Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that he might die there in the desert. At other times, it told the boy that it was satisfied: it had found love and riches.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“My heart is a traitor,” the boy said to the alchemist, when they had paused to rest the horses. “It doesn’t want me to go on.</span><span id="page_136" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That makes sense,” the alchemist answered. “Naturally it’s afraid that, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you’ve won.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there inside you, repeating to you what you’re thinking about life and about the world.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You mean I should listen, even if it’s treasonous?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your heart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you’ll know its dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it’s better to listen to what it has to say. That way, you’ll never have to fear an unanticipated blow.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it as it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to the oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy. “Even though I complain sometimes,” it said, “it’s because I’m the heart of a person, and people’s hearts are that way. People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they don’t deserve them, or </span><span id="page_137" class="class16"/><span class="class16">that they’ll be unable to achieve them. We, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go away forever, or of moments that could have been good but weren’t, or of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we suffer terribly.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,” the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second’s encounter with God and with eternity.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Every second of the search is an encounter with God,” the boy told his heart. “When I have been truly searching for my treasure, every day has been luminous, because I’ve known that every hour was a part of the dream that I would find it. When I have been truly searching for my treasure, I’ve discovered things along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">So his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon. That night, the boy slept deeply, and, when he awoke, his heart began to tell him things that came from the Soul of the World. It said that all people who are happy have God within them. And that </span><span id="page_138" class="class16"/><span class="class16">happiness could be found in a grain of sand from the desert, as the alchemist had said. Because a grain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe has taken millions of years to create it. “Everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him,” his heart said. “We, people’s hearts, seldom say much about those treasures, because people no longer want to go in search of them. We speak of them only to children. Later, we simply let life proceed, in its own direction, toward its own fate. But, unfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to their Personal Legends, and to happiness. Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“So, we, their hearts, speak more and more softly. We never stop speaking out, but we begin to hope that our words won’t be heard: we don’t want people to suffer because they don’t follow their hearts.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why don’t people’s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams?” the boy asked the alchemist.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because that’s what makes a heart suffer most, and hearts don’t like to suffer.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">From then on, the boy understood his heart. He asked it, please, never to stop speaking to him. He asked that, when he wandered far from his dreams, </span><span id="page_139" class="class16"/><span class="class16">his heart press him and sound the alarm. The boy swore that, every time he heard the alarm, he would heed its message.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">That night, he told all of this to the alchemist. And the alchemist understood that the boy’s heart had returned to the Soul of the World.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“So what should I do now?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Continue in the direction of the Pyramids,” said the alchemist. “And continue to pay heed to the omens. Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Is that the one thing I still needed to know?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“No,” the alchemist answered. “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which most people give up. It’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.’</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy remembered an old proverb from his country. It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" id="page_140" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">On the following day, the first clear sign of danger appeared. Three armed tribesmen approached, and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m hunting with my falcon,” the alchemist answered.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“We’re going to have to search you to see whether you’re armed,” one of the tribesmen said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist dismounted slowly, and the boy did the same.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Why are you carrying money?” asked the tribesman, when he had searched the boy’s bag.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I need it to get to the Pyramids,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The tribesman who was searching the alchemist’s belongings found a small crystal flask filled with a liquid, and a yellow glass egg that was slightly larger than a chicken’s egg.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What are these things?” he asked.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image1109.jpg" alt="" class="class31"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life. It’s the Master Work of the alchemists. Whoever swallows that elixir will never be sick again, and a fragment from that stone turns any metal into gold.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Arabs laughed at him, and the alchemist laughed along. They thought his answer was amusing, and they allowed the boy and the alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings</span><span id="page_141" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Are you crazy?” the boy asked the alchemist, when they had moved on. “What did you do that for?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“To show you one of life’s simple lessons,” the alchemist answered. “When you possess great treasures within you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They continued across the desert. With every day that passed, the boy’s heart became more and more silent. It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future; it was content simply to contemplate the desert, and to drink with the boy from the Soul of the World. The boy and his heart had become friends, and neither was capable now of betraying the other.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a stimulus to the boy, and to give him strength, because the days of silence there in the desert were wearisome. His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were: his courage in having given up his sheep and in trying to live out his Personal Legend, and his enthusiasm during the time he had worked at the crystal shop.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And his heart told him something else that the boy had never noticed: it told the boy of dangers that had threatened him, but that he had never perceived. His heart said that one time it had hidden the rifle the boy had taken from his father, </span><span id="page_142" class="class16"/><span class="class16">because of the possibility that the boy might wound himself. And it reminded the boy of the day when he had been ill and vomiting out in the fields, after which he had fallen into a deep sleep. There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy’s sheep and murder him. But, since the boy hadn’t passed by, they had decided to move on, thinking that he had changed his route.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Does a man’s heart always help him?” the boy asked the alchemist.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their Personal Legends. But they do help children, drunkards, and the elderly, too.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Does that mean that I’ll never run into danger?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It means only that the heart does what it can,” the alchemist said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">One afternoon, they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes. At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful white robes, with arms at the ready. The men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield. No one paid any attention to the two travelers.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“There’s no danger,” the boy said, when they had moved on past the encampment.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist sounded angry: “Trust in your heart, but never forget that you’re in the desert. When men are at war with one another, the Soul of the World can hear the screams of battle. No one </span><span id="page_143" class="class16"/><span class="class16">fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">All things are one, the boy thought. And then, as if the desert wanted to demonstrate that the alchemist was right, two horsemen appeared from behind the travelers.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You can’t go any farther,” one of them said. “You’re in the area where the tribes are at war.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m not going very far,” the alchemist answered, looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen. They were silent for a moment, and then agreed that the boy and the alchemist could move along.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy watched the exchange with fascination. “You dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Your eyes show the strength of your soul,” answered the alchemist.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">That’s true, the boy thought. He had noticed that, in the midst of the multitude of armed men back at the encampment, there had been one who stared fixedly at the two. He had been so far away that his face wasn’t even visible. But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Finally, when they had crossed the mountain range that extended along the entire horizon, the alchemist said that they were only two days from the Pyramids.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“If we’re going to go our separate ways soon,” the boy said, “then teach me about alchemy.</span><span id="page_144" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You already know about alchemy. It is about penetrating to the Soul of the World, and discovering the treasure that has been reserved for you.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“No, that’s not what I mean. I’m talking about transforming lead into gold.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist fell as silent as the desert, and answered the boy only after they had stopped to eat.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Everything in the universe evolved,” he said. “And, for wise men, gold is the metal that evolved the furthest. Don’t ask me why; I don’t know why. I just know that the Tradition is always right.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Men have never understood the words of the wise. So gold, instead of being seen as a symbol of evolution, became the basis for conflict.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“There are many languages spoken by things,” the boy said. “There was a time when, for me, a camel’s whinnying was nothing more than whinnying. Then it became a signal of danger. And, finally, it became just a whinny again.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But then he stopped. The alchemist probably already knew all that.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I have known true alchemists,” the alchemist continued. “They locked themselves in their laboratories, and tried to evolve, as gold had. And they found the Philosopher’s Stone, because they understood that when something evolves, everything around that thing evolves as well.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Others stumbled upon the stone by accident. They already had the gift, and their souls were </span><span id="page_145" class="class16"/><span class="class16">readier for such things than the souls of others. But they don’t count. They’re quite rare.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And then there were the others, who were interested only in gold. They never found the secret. They forgot that lead, copper, and iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill. And anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist’s words echoed out like a curse. He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“This desert was once a sea,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I noticed that,” the boy answered.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image1147.jpg" alt="" class="class31"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear. He had done that many times when he was a child, and had heard the sound of the sea.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The sea has lived on in this shell, because that’s its Personal Legend. And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They mounted their horses, and rode out in the direction of the Pyramids of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The sun was setting when the boy’s heart sounded a danger signal. They were surrounded by gigantic dunes, and the boy looked at the alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything. But he appeared to be unaware of any danger. Five minutes later, the boy saw two horsemen waiting ahead of <span id="page_146"/>them. Before he could say anything to the alchemist, the two horsemen had become ten, and then a hundred. And then they were everywhere in the dunes.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They were tribesmen dressed in blue, with black rings surrounding their turbans. Their faces were hidden behind blue veils, with only their eyes showing.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Even from a distance, their eyes conveyed the strength of their souls. And their eyes spoke of death.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The two were taken to a nearby military camp. A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“These are the spies,” said one of the men.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“We’re just travelers,” the alchemist answered.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago. And you were talking with one of the troops there.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars,” said the alchemist. “I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes. I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Who is your friend?” the chief asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“An alchemist,” said the alchemist. “He understands the forces of nature. And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers.</span><span id="page_147" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy listened quietly. And fearfully.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What is a foreigner doing here?” asked another of the men.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“He has brought money to give to your tribe,” said the alchemist, before the boy could say a word. And seizing the boy’s bag, the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The Arab accepted them without a word. There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What is an alchemist?” he asked, finally.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s a man who understands nature and the world. If he wanted to, he could destroy this camp just with the force of the wind.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The men laughed. They were used to the ravages of war, and knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow. Yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster. They were men of the desert, and they were fearful of sorcerers.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I want to see him do it,” said the chief.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“He needs three days,” answered the alchemist. “He is going to transform himself into the wind, just to demonstrate his powers. If he can’t do so, we humbly offer you our lives, for the honor of your tribe.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You can’t offer me something that is already mine,” the chief said, arrogantly. But he granted the travelers three days.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was shaking with fear, but the alchemist helped him out of the tent</span><span id="page_148" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Don’t let them see that you’re afraid,” the alchemist said. “They are brave men, and they despise cowards.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the boy couldn’t even speak. He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp. There was no need to imprison them: the Arabs simply confiscated their horses. So, once again, the world had demonstrated its many languages: the desert only moments ago had been endless and free, and now it was an impenetrable wall.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You gave them everything I had!” the boy said. “Everything I’ve saved in my entire life!”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, what good would it be to you if you had to die?” the alchemist answered. “Your money saved us for three days. It’s not often that money saves a person’s life.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom. He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind. He wasn’t an alchemist!</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist asked one of the soldiers for some tea, and poured some on the boy’s wrists. A wave of relief washed over him, and the alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn’t understand.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Don’t give in to your fears,” said the alchemist, in a strangely gentle voice. “If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.</span><span id="page_149" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows everything he needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m not afraid of failing. It’s just that I don’t know how to turn myself into the wind.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, you’ll have to learn; your life depends on it.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But what if I can’t?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Then you’ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal Legend. That’s a lot better than dying like millions of other people, who never even knew what their Personal Legends were.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But don’t worry,” the alchemist continued. “Usually the threat of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives.”</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The first day passed. There was a major battle nearby, and a number of wounded were brought back to the camp. The dead soldiers were replaced by others, and life went on. Death doesn’t change anything, the boy thought.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You could have died later on,” a soldier said to the body of one of his companions. “You could </span><span id="page_150" class="class16"/><span class="class16">have died after peace had been declared. But, in any case, you were going to die.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">At the end of the day, the boy went looking for the alchemist, who had taken his falcon out into the desert.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind,” the boy repeated.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Remember what I told you: the world is only the visible aspect of God. And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What are you doing?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Feeding my falcon.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“If I’m not able to turn myself into the wind, we’re going to die,” the boy said. “Why feed your falcon?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You’re the one who may die,” the alchemist said. “I already know how to turn myself into the wind.”</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">On the second day, the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp. The sentinels allowed him to go; they had already heard about the sorcerer who could turn himself into the wind, and they didn’t want to go near him. In any case, the desert was impassable.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over the desert, and listening to his </span><span id="page_151" class="class16"/><span class="class16">heart. The boy knew the desert sensed his fear.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They both spoke the same language.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">On the third day, the chief met with his officers. He called the alchemist to the meeting and said, “Let’s go see the boy who turns himself into the wind.”</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Let’s,” the alchemist answered.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day. He told them all to be seated.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“It’s going to take awhile,” the boy said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“We’re in no hurry,” the chief answered. “We are men of the desert.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy looked out at the horizon. There were mountains in the distance. And there were dunes, rocks, and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible. There was the desert that he had wandered for so many months; despite all that time, he knew only a small part of it. Within that small part, he had found an Englishman, caravans, tribal wars, and an oasis with fifty thousand palm trees and three hundred wells.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image1211.jpg" alt="" class="class28"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What do you want here today?” the desert asked him. “Didn’t you spend enough time looking at me yesterday?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Somewhere you are holding the person I love,” the boy said. “So, when I look out over your sands, </span><span id="page_152" class="class16"/><span class="class16">I am also looking at her. I want to return to her, and I need your help so that I can turn myself into the wind.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What is love?” the desert asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Love is the falcon’s flight over your sands. Because for him, you are a green field, from which he always returns with game. He knows your rocks, your dunes, and your mountains, and you are generous to him.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The falcon’s beak carries bits of me, myself,” the desert said. “For years, I care for his game, feeding it with the little water that I have, and then I show him where the game is. And, one day, as I enjoy the fact that his game thrives on my surface, the falcon dives out of the sky, and takes away what I’ve created.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But that’s why you created the game in the first place,” the boy answered. “To nourish the falcon. And the falcon then nourishes man. And, eventually, man will nourish your sands, where the game will once again flourish. That’s how the world goes.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“So is that what love is?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Yes, that’s what love is. It’s what makes the game become the falcon, the falcon become man, and man, in his turn, the desert. It’s what turns lead into gold, and makes the gold return to the earth.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I don’t understand what you’re talking about,” the desert said</span><span id="page_153" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me. And that’s why I have to turn myself into the wind.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The desert didn’t answer him for a few moments.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Then it told him, “I’ll give you my sands to help the wind to blow, but, alone, I can’t do anything. You have to ask for help from the wind.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">A breeze began to blow. The tribesmen watched the boy from a distance, talking among themselves in a language that the boy couldn’t understand.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist smiled.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The wind approached the boy and touched his face. It knew of the boy’s talk with the desert, because the winds know everything. They blow across the world without a birthplace, and with no place to die.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Help me,” the boy said. “One day you carried the voice of my loved one to me.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“My heart,” the boy answered.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The wind has many names. In that part of the world, it was called the sirocco, because it brought moisture from the oceans to the east. In the distant land the boy came from, they called it the levanter, because they believed that it brought with it the sands of the desert, and the screams of the Moorish </span><span id="page_154" class="class16"/><span class="class16">wars. Perhaps, in the places beyond the pastures where his sheep lived, men thought that the wind came from Andalusia. But, actually, the wind came from no place at all, nor did it go to any place; that’s why it was stronger than the desert. Someone might one day plant trees in the desert, and even raise sheep there, but never would they harness the wind.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You can’t be the wind,” the wind said. “We’re two very different things.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s not true,” the boy said. “I learned the alchemist’s secrets in my travels. I have inside me the winds, the deserts, the oceans, the stars, and everything created in the universe. We were all made by the same hand, and we have the same soul. I want to be like you, able to reach every corner of the world, cross the seas, blow away the sands that cover my treasure, and carry the voice of the woman I love.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist,” the wind said. “He said that everything has its own Personal Legend. But people can’t turn themselves into the wind.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Just teach me to be the wind for a few moments,” the boy said. “So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The wind’s curiosity was aroused, something that had never happened before. It wanted to talk about those things, but it didn’t know how to turn </span><span id="page_155" class="class16"/><span class="class16">a man into the wind. And look how many things the wind already knew how to do! It created deserts, sank ships, felled entire forests, and blew through cities filled with music and strange noises. It felt that it had no limits, yet here was a boy saying that there were other things the wind should be able to do.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“This is what we call love,” the boy said, seeing that the wind was close to granting what he requested. “When you are loved, you can do anything in creation. When you are loved, there’s no need at all to understand what’s happening, because everything happens within you, and even men can turn themselves into the wind. As long as the wind helps, of course.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The wind was a proud being, and it was becoming irritated with what the boy was saying. It commenced to blow harder, raising the desert sands. But finally it had to recognize that, even making its way around the world, it didn’t know how to turn a man into the wind. And it knew nothing about love.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“In my travels around the world, I’ve often seen people speaking of love and looking toward the heavens,” the wind said, furious at having to acknowledge its own limitations. “Maybe it’s better to ask heaven.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well then, help me do that,” the boy said. “Fill this place with a sandstorm so strong that it blots </span><span id="page_156" class="class16"/><span class="class16">out the sun. Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">So the wind blew with all its strength, and the sky was filled with sand. The sun was turned into a golden disk.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">At the camp, it was difficult to see anything. The men of the desert were already familiar with that wind. They called it the </span><span class="class17">simum,</span><span class="class16"> and it was worse than a storm at sea. Their horses cried out, and all their weapons were filled with sand.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">On the heights, one of the commanders turned to the chief and said, “Maybe we had better end this!”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They could barely see the boy. Their faces were covered with the blue cloths, and their eyes showed fear.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Let’s stop this,” another commander said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I want to see the greatness of Allah,” the chief said, with respect. “I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had expressed their fear. As soon as the wind stopped, he was going to remove them from their commands, because true men of the desert are not afraid.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The wind told me that you know about love,” the boy said to the sun. “If you know about love, you must also know about the Soul of the World, because it’s made of love.</span><span id="page_157" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“From where I am,” the sun said, “I can see the Soul of the World. It communicates with my soul, and together we cause the plants to grow and the sheep to seek out shade. From where I am—and I’m a long way from the earth—I learned how to love. I know that if I came even a little bit closer to the earth, everything there would die, and the Soul of the World would no longer exist. So we contemplate each other, and we want each other, and I give it life and warmth, and it gives me my reason for living.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“So you know about love,” the boy said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And I know the Soul of the World, because we have talked at great length to each other during this endless trip through the universe. It tells me that its greatest problem is that, up until now, only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one. That there’s no need for iron to be the same as copper, or copper the same as gold. Each performs its own exact function as a unique being, and everything would be a symphony of peace if the hand that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But there was a sixth day,” the sun went on.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“You are wise, because you observe everything from a distance,” the boy said. “But you don’t know about love. If there hadn’t been a sixth day, man would not exist; copper would always be just copper, and lead just lead. It’s true that everything </span><span id="page_158" class="class16"/><span class="class16">has its Personal Legend, but one day that Personal Legend will be realized. So each thing has to transform itself into something better, and to acquire a new Personal Legend, until, someday, the Soul of the World becomes one thing only.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The sun thought about that, and decided to shine more brightly. The wind, which was enjoying the conversation, started to blow with greater force, so that the sun would not blind the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“This is why alchemy exists,” the boy said. “So that everyone will search for his treasure, find it, and then want to be better than he was in his former life. Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead; and then lead will have to turn itself into gold.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“That’s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Well, why did you say that I don’t know about love?” the sun asked the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because it’s not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to roam the world like the wind. And it’s not love to see everything from a distance, like you do. Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World. When I first reached through to it, I thought the Soul of the World was perfect. But later, I could see that it was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and </span><span id="page_159" class="class16"/><span class="class16">wars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the World, and the world we live in will be either better or worse, depending on whether we become better or worse. And that’s where the power of love comes in. Because when we love, we always strive to become better than we are.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“So what do you want of me?” the sun asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I want you to help me turn myself into the wind,” the boy answered.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Nature knows me as the wisest being in creation,” the sun said. “But I don’t know how to turn you into the wind.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Then, whom should I ask?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The sun thought for a minute. The wind was listening closely, and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun’s wisdom had its limitations. That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Speak to the hand that wrote all,” said the sun.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The wind screamed with delight, and blew harder than ever. The tents were being blown from their ties to the earth, and the animals were being freed from their tethers. On the cliff, the men clutched at each other as they sought to keep from being blown away.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy turned to the hand that wrote all. As he did so, he sensed that the universe had fallen silent, and he decided not to speak</span><span id="page_160" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">A current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to pray. It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a prayer without words or pleas. His prayer didn’t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures; it didn’t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal; and it didn’t beseech that the woman he had met continue to await his return. In the silence, the boy understood that the desert, the wind, and the sun were also trying to understand the signs written by the hand, and were seeking to follow their paths, and to understand what had been written on a single emerald. He saw that omens were scattered throughout the earth and in space, and that there was no reason or significance attached to their appearance; he could see that not the deserts, nor the winds, nor the sun, nor people knew why they had been created. But that the hand had a reason for all of this, and that only the hand could perform miracles, or transform the sea into a desert . . . or a man into the wind. Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy reached through to the Soul of the World, and saw that it was a part of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was his own soul. And that he, a boy, could perform miracles.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" id="page_161" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The <span class="class11">simum</span> blew that day as it had never blown before. For generations thereafter, the Arabs recounted the legend of a boy who had turned himself into the wind, almost destroying a military camp, in defiance of the most powerful chief in the desert.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When the </span><span class="class17">simum</span><span class="class16"> ceased to blow, everyone looked to the place where the boy had been. But he was no longer there; he was standing next to a sand-covered sentinel, on the far side of the camp.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The men were terrified at his sorcery. But there were two people who were smiling: the alchemist, because he had found his perfect disciple, and the chief, because that disciple had understood the glory of God.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The following day, the general bade the boy and the alchemist farewell, and provided them with an escort party to accompany them as far as they chose.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">They rode for the entire day. Toward the end of the afternoon, they came upon a Coptic monastery. The alchemist dismounted, and told the escorts they could return to the camp.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“From here on, you will be alone,” the alchemist said. “You are only three hours from the Pyramids.</span><span id="page_162" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Thank you,” said the boy. “You taught me the Language of the World.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I only invoked what you already knew.”</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image1280.jpg" alt="" class="class28"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery. A monk dressed in black came to the gates. They spoke for a few minutes in the Coptic tongue, and the alchemist bade the boy enter.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while,” the alchemist smiled.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery. The alchemist lighted the fire, and the monk brought him some lead, which the alchemist placed in an iron pan. When the lead had become liquid, the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg. He scraped from it a sliver as thin as a hair, wrapped it in wax, and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The mixture took on a reddish color, almost the color of blood. The alchemist removed the pan from the fire, and set it aside to cool. As he did so, he talked with the monk about the tribal wars.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I think they’re going to last for a long time,” he said to the monk.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The monk was irritated. The caravans had been stopped at Giza for some time, waiting for the wars to end. “But God’s will be done,” the monk said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Exactly,” answered the alchemist</span><span id="page_163" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When the pan had cooled, the monk and the boy looked at it, dazzled. The lead had dried into the shape of the pan, but it was no longer lead. It was gold.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Will I learn to do that someday?” the boy asked.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“This was my Personal Legend, not yours,” the alchemist answered. “But I wanted to show you that it was possible.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They returned to the gates of the monastery. There, the alchemist separated the disk into four parts.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“This is for you,” he said, holding one of the parts out to the monk. “It’s for your generosity to the pilgrims.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But this payment goes well beyond my generosity,” the monk responded.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Don’t say that again. Life might be listening, and give you less the next time.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist turned to the boy. “This is for you. To make up for what you gave to the general.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had given the general. But he kept quiet, because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And this is for me,” said the alchemist, keeping one of the parts. “Because I have to return to the desert, where there are tribal wars.</span><span id="page_164" class="class16"/><span class="class16">”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“This is for the boy. If he ever needs it.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“But I’m going in search of my treasure,” the boy said. “I’m very close to it now.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“And I’m certain you’ll find it,” the alchemist said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Then why this?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Because you have already lost your savings twice. Once to the thief, and once to the general. I’m an old, superstitious Arab, and I believe in our proverbs. There’s one that says, ‘Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.’” They mounted their horses.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">“I want to tell you a story about dreams,” said the alchemist.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy brought his horse closer.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“In ancient Rome, at the time of Emperor Tiberius, there lived a good man who had two sons. One was in the military, and had been sent to the most distant regions of the empire. The other son was a poet, and delighted all of Rome with his beautiful verses.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“One night, the father had a dream. An angel appeared to him, and told him that the words of one </span><span id="page_165" class="class16"/><span class="class16">of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come. The father woke from his dream grateful and crying, because life was generous, and had revealed to him something any father would be proud to know.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Shortly thereafter, the father died as he tried to save a child who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot. Since he had lived his entire life in a manner that was correct and fair, he went directly to heaven, where he met the angel that had appeared in his dream.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘You were always a good man,’ the angel said to him. ‘You lived your life in a loving way, and died with dignity. I can now grant you any wish you desire.’</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘Life was good to me,’ the man said. ‘When you appeared in my dream, I felt that all my efforts had been rewarded, because my son’s poems will be read by men for generations to come. I don’t want anything for myself. But any father would be proud of the fame achieved by one whom he had cared for as a child, and educated as he grew up. Sometime in the distant future, I would like to see my son’s words.’</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The angel touched the man’s shoulder, and they were both projected far into the future. They were in an immense setting, surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language</span><span id="page_166" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The man wept with happiness.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘I knew that my son’s poems were immortal,’ he said to the angel through his tears. ‘Can you please tell me which of my son’s poems these people are repeating?’</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The angel came closer to the man, and, with tenderness, led him to a bench nearby, where they sat down.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in Rome,’ the angel said. ‘Everyone loved them and enjoyed them. But when the reign of Tiberius ended, his poems were forgotten. The words you’re hearing now are those of your son in the military.’</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“The man looked at the angel in surprise.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘Your son went to serve at a distant place, and became a centurion. He was just and good. One afternoon, one of his servants fell ill, and it appeared that he would die. Your son had heard of a rabbi who was able to cure illnesses, and he rode out for days and days in search of this man. Along the way, he learned that the man he was seeking was the Son of God. He met others who had been cured by him, and they instructed your son in the man’s teachings. And so, despite the fact that he was a Roman centurion, he converted to their faith. Shortly thereafter, he reached the place where the man he was looking for was visiting.</span><span id="page_167" class="class16"/><span class="class16">’</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘He told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill, and the rabbi made ready to go to his house with him. But the centurion was a man of faith, and, looking into the eyes of the rabbi, he knew that he was surely in the presence of the Son of God.’</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“‘And this is what your son said,’ the angel told the man. ‘These are the words he said to the rabbi at that point, and they have never been forgotten: “My Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. But only speak a word and my servant will be healed.” ’”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The alchemist said, “No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn’t know it.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy smiled. He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Good-bye,” the alchemist said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Good-bye,” said the boy.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image174.jpg" alt="" class="class27"/></div>
<div class="class14">The boy rode along through the desert for several hours, listening avidly to what his heart had to say. It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden<span id="page_168"/>.</div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,” the alchemist had told him.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But his heart was speaking of other things. With pride, it told the story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had on two different occasions. It told of Personal Legend, and of the many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful women, confronting the people of their times with their preconceived notions. It spoke of journeys, discoveries, books, and change.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">As he was about to climb yet another dune, his heart whispered, “Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears. That’s where I am, and that’s where your treasure is.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy climbed the dune slowly. A full moon rose again in the starry sky: it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis. The moonlight cast shadows through the dunes, creating the appearance of a rolling sea; it reminded the boy of the day when that horse had reared in the desert, and he had come to know the alchemist. And the moon fell on the desert’s silence, and on a man’s journey in search of treasure.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">When he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt. There, illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the desert, stood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making him believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to </span><span id="page_169" class="class16"/><span class="class16">meet a king, a merchant, an Englishman, and an alchemist. And above all for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">If he wanted to, he could now return to the oasis, go back to Fatima, and live his life as a simple shepherd. After all, the alchemist continued to live in the desert, even though he understood the Language of the World, and knew how to transform lead into gold. He didn’t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone. The boy told himself that, on the way toward realizing his own Personal Legend, he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced everything he might have dreamed of.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But here he was, at the point of finding his treasure, and he reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has been achieved. The boy looked at the sands around him, and saw that, where his tears had fallen, a scarab beetle was scuttling through the sand. During his time in the desert, he had learned that, in Egypt, the scarab beetles are a symbol of God.</span></div>
<div class="class20"><img src="image1337.jpg" alt="" class="class38"/></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Another omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so, he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard. The boy could see now that he couldn’t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life</span><span id="page_170" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Throughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, but found nothing. He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built. But he didn’t stop. He struggled to continue digging as he fought the wind, which often blew the sand back into the excavation. His hands were abraded and exhausted, but he listened to his heart. It had told him to dig where his tears fell.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">As he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered, he heard footsteps. Several figures approached him. Their backs were to the moonlight, and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their faces.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What are you doing here?” one of the figures demanded.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Because he was terrified, the boy didn’t answer. He had found where his treasure was, and was frightened at what might happen.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“We’re refugees from the tribal wars, and we need money,” the other figure said. “What are you hiding there?”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“I’m not hiding anything,” the boy answered.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole. Another, who was searching the boy’s bags, found the piece of gold.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“There’s gold here,” he said.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The moon shone on the face of the Arab who had seized him, and in the man’s eyes the boy saw death</span><span id="page_171" class="class16"/><span class="class16">.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“He’s probably got more gold hidden in the ground.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">They made the boy continue digging, but he found nothing. As the sun rose, the men began to beat the boy. He was bruised and bleeding, his clothing was torn to shreds, and he felt that death was near.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">“What good is money to you if you’re going to die? It’s not often that money can save someone’s life,” the alchemist had said. Finally, the boy screamed at the men, “I’m digging for treasure!” And, although his mouth was bleeding and swollen, he told his attackers that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others: “Leave him. He doesn’t have anything else. He must have stolen this gold.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy fell to the sand, nearly unconscious. The leader shook him and said, “We’re leaving.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">But before they left, he came back to the boy and said, “You’re not going to die. You’ll live, and you’ll learn that a man shouldn’t be so stupid. Two years ago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent dream, too. I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept. In my dream, there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of </span><span id="page_172" class="class16"/><span class="class16">the sacristy, and I was told that, if I dug at the roots of the sycamore, I would find a hidden treasure. But I’m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream.”</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">And they disappeared.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">The boy stood up shakily, and looked once more at the Pyramids. They seemed to laugh at him, and he laughed back, his heart bursting with joy.</span></div>
<div class="class15"><span class="class16">Because now he knew where his treasure was.</span></div>
